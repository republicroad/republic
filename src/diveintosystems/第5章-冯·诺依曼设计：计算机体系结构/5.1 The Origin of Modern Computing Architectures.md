## 5.1. The Origin of Modern Computing Architectures

When tracing the ancestry of modern computing architecture, it is tempting to consider that modern computers are part of a linear chain of successive transmutations, with each machine simply an improvement of the one that previously existed. While this view of inherited improvements in computer design may hold true for certain classes of architecture (consider the iterative improvements of the iPhone X from the original iPhone), the root of the architectural tree is much less defined.
追溯现代计算架构的起源，人们很容易认为现代计算机是连续演变的线性链条的一部分，每台机器都只是对之前存在的机器的改进。虽然这种继承计算机设计改进的观点可能适用于某些类型的架构（想想 iPhone X 从最初的 iPhone 开始的迭代改进），但架构树的根源却不那么明确。

From the 1700s until the early 1900s, mathematicians served as the first _human_ computers for calculations related to applications of science and engineering1. The word "computer" originally referred to "one who computes". Women mathematicians often served in the role of computer. In fact, the use of women as human computers was so pervasive that computational complexity was measured in "kilo-girls", or the amount of work a thousand human computers could complete in one hour2. Women were widely considered to be better at doing mathematical calculations than men, as they tended to be more methodical. Women were not allowed to hold the position of engineer. As such, they were relegated to more "menial" work, such as computing complex calculations.
从 18 世纪到 20 世纪初，数学家是第一批用于科学和工程应用相关计算的“人脑”计算机。“计算机”一词最初是指“计算的人”。女数学家经常担任计算机的角色。事实上，女性作为人脑计算机的使用非常普遍，以至于计算复杂度以“千人计算机”来衡量，即一千台人脑计算机在一小时内可以完成的工作量。人们普遍认为女性比男性更擅长做数学计算，因为她们往往更有条理。女性不被允许担任工程师。因此，她们被降级为更“卑微”的工作，例如计算复杂的计算。

The first general-purpose digital computer, the _Analytical Engine_, was designed by British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is credited by some as the father of the computer. The Analytical Engine was an extension of his original invention, the Difference Engine, a mechanical calculator that was capable of calculating polynomial functions. Ada Lovelace, who perhaps should be known as the mother of computing, was the very first person to develop a computer program and the first to publish an algorithm that could be computed using Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. In her notes is included her recognition of the general-purpose nature of the Analytical Engine: "[t]he Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.3" However, unlike modern computers, the Analytical Engine was a mechanical device and was only partially built. Most of the designers of what became the direct forerunners to the modern computer were unaware of the work of Babbage and Lovelace when they developed their own machines.
第一台通用数字计算机分析机是由英国数学家查尔斯·巴贝奇设计的，他被一些人誉为计算机之父。分析机是他最初发明的差分机的延伸，差分机是一种能够计算多项式函数的机械计算器。艾达·洛夫莱斯也许应该被称为计算机之母，她是第一个开发计算机程序的人，也是第一个发布可以使用查尔斯·巴贝奇的分析机进行计算的算法的人。在她的笔记中，包括了她对分析机通用性的认识：“分析机不具备任何创造任何东西的本领。它可以做任何我们知道的命令它做的事情。3”然而，与现代计算机不同，分析机是一种机械装置，而且只是部分建成。大多数成为现代计算机直接前身的设计师在开发自己的机器时，并不知道巴贝奇和洛夫莱斯的工作。

Thus, it is perhaps more accurate to think about modern computer architecture rising out of a primordial soup of ideas and innovations that arose in the 1930s and 1940s. For example, in 1937, Claude Shannon, a student at MIT, wrote what would go on to be perhaps the most influential masters thesis of all time. Drawing upon the work of George Boole (the mathematician who developed Boolean algebra), Shannon showed that Boolean logic could be applied to circuits and could be used to develop electrical switches. This would lead to the development of the binary computing system, and much of future digital circuit design. While men would design many early electronic computers, women (who were not allowed to be engineers) became programming pioneers, leading the design and development of many early software innovations, such as programming languages, compilers, algorithms, and operating systems.
因此，或许更准确地说，现代计算机架构源自 20 世纪 30 年代和 40 年代出现的大量原始思想和创新。例如，1937 年，麻省理工学院的学生克劳德·香农 (Claude Shannon) 撰写了一篇后来成为有史以来最具影响力的硕士论文。香农借鉴了乔治·布尔（开发布尔代数的数学家）的工作，表明布尔逻辑可以应用于电路并可用于开发电气开关。这将导致二进制计算系统的发展，以及未来许多数字电路设计的发展。虽然许多早期的电子计算机都是由男性设计的，但女性（她们不允许成为工程师）成为编程先驱，领导了许多早期软件创新的设计和开发，例如编程语言、编译器、算法和操作系统。

A comprehensive discussion of the rise of computer architecture is not possible in this book (see _Turing’s Cathedral_4 by George Dyson and _The Innovators_6 by Walter Isaacson for more detailed coverage); however, we briefly enumerate several significant innovations that occurred in the 1930s and 1940s that were instrumental in the rise of modern computer architecture.
本书无法全面讨论计算机架构的兴起（有关更详细的介绍，请参阅乔治戴森的《图灵大教堂》4 和沃尔特艾萨克森的《创新者》6）；但我们简要列举了 20 世纪 30 年代和 40 年代发生的几项重大创新，这些创新对现代计算机架构的兴起起到了重要作用。

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/hist.html#_the_turing_machine)5.1.1. The Turing Machine图灵机

In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing proposed7 the "Logical Computing Machine", a theoretical computer. Turing used this machine to prove that there exists no solution to the decision problem (in German, the _Entscheidungsproblem_), posed by the mathematicians David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928. The decision problem is an algorithm that takes a statement as input and determines whether the statement is universally valid. Turing proved that no such algorithm exists by showing that the _halting problem_ (will machine _X_ halt on input _y_?) was undecidable for Turing’s machine. As part of this proof, Turing described a universal machine that is capable of performing the tasks of any other computing machine. Alonzo Church, Turing’s dissertation advisor at Princeton University, was the first to refer to the _logical computing machine_ as the _Turing machine_, and its universal form as the _universal Turing machine_.
1937 年，英国数学家阿兰·图灵提出7“逻辑计算机”，一种理论计算机。图灵使用这台机器证明了数学家戴维·希尔伯特和威廉·阿克曼于 1928 年提出的决策问题 (德语为 _Entscheidungsproblem_) 没有解。决策问题是一种以语句作为输入并确定该语句是否普遍有效的算法。图灵通过证明 _停机问题_ (机器 _X_ 是否会在输入 _y_ 时停止？) 对于图灵机是不可判定的，证明了不存在这样的算法。作为这一证明的一部分，图灵描述了一种能够执行任何其他计算机器任务的通用机器。图灵在普林斯顿大学的论文导师阿隆佐·丘奇是第一个将_逻辑计算机_称为_图灵机_，并将其通用形式称为 _通用图灵机_ 的人。

Turing later returned to England and served his country as part of the code breaking unit in Bletchley Park during World War II. He was instrumental in the design and construction of the _Bombe_, an electromechanical device that helped break the cipher produced by the Enigma machine, which was commonly used by Nazi Germany to protect sensitive communication during World War II.
图灵后来回到英国，在第二次世界大战期间作为布莱切利园密码破译小组的一员为祖国效力。他在 Bombe 的设计和建造中发挥了重要作用。Bombe 是一种机电设备，帮助破解了恩尼格玛密码机生成的密码，而恩尼格玛密码机在第二次世界大战期间被纳粹德国广泛用于保护敏感通信。

After the war, Turing designed the _automatic computing engine_ (ACE). The ACE was a stored-program computer, meaning that both the program instructions and its data are loaded into the computer memory and run by the general-purpose computer. His paper, published in 1946, is perhaps the most detailed description of such a computer8.
战后，图灵设计了自动计算机（ACE）。ACE 是一种存储程序计算机，这意味着程序指令及其数据都加载到计算机内存中并由通用计算机运行。他的论文发表于 1946 年，可能是对这种计算机最详细的描述8。

World War II accelerated much of the development of early computers. However, due to the classified nature of military operations in World War II, many of the details of innovations that occurred as a result of the frenetic activity during the war was not publicly acknowledged until years later. A good example of this is Colossus, a machine designed by British engineer Tommy Flowers to help break the Lorenz cipher, which was used by Nazi Germany to encode high-level intelligence communication. Some of Alan Turing’s work aided in its design. Built in 1943, Colossus is arguably the first programmable, digital, and fully electronic computer. However, it was a special-purpose computer, designed specifically for code breaking. The Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS, known as the "Wrens") served as operators of Colossus. In spite of the _General Report of the Tunny_14 noting that several of the Wrens showed ability in cryptographic work, none of them were given the position of cryptographer, and instead were delegated more menial Colossus operation tasks5,15.
第二次世界大战加速了早期计算机的发展。然而，由于第二次世界大战军事行动的机密性质，许多因战争期间的激烈活动而产生的创新细节直到多年后才被公开承认。一个很好的例子是 Colossus，这是一台由英国工程师 Tommy Flowers 设计的机器，用于帮助破解 Lorenz 密码，纳粹德国曾使用 Lorenz 密码对高级情报通信进行编码。Alan Turing 的一些工作也为其设计提供了帮助。Colossus 于 1943 年制造，可以说是第一台可编程、数字化、全电子化的计算机。然而，它是一台专用计算机，专为密码破解而设计。皇家海军女子服务队 (WRNS，又称“Wrens”) 是 Colossus 的操作员。尽管《金枪鱼总报告》14 指出，几位雷恩级人员表现出了密码工作方面的能力，但他们都没有被授予密码员的职位，而是被委派了更为琐碎的巨像操作任务5,15。

On the other side of the Atlantic, American scientists and engineers were hard at work creating computers of their own. Harvard professor Howard Aiken (who was also a Naval Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserves) designed the Mark I, an electromechanical, general-purpose programmable computer. Built in 1944, it aided in the design of the atomic bomb. Aiken built his computer largely unaware of Turing’s work and was motivated by the goal of bringing Charles Babbage’s analytical engine to life6. A key feature of the Mark I was that it was fully automatic and able to run for days without human intervention6. This would be a foundational feature in future computer design.
在大西洋彼岸，美国科学家和工程师们正在努力创造自己的计算机。哈佛大学教授霍华德·艾肯（他也是海军预备役的海军指挥官）设计了 Mark I，这是一款机电式通用可编程计算机。它于 1944 年制造，为原子弹的设计提供了帮助。艾肯在制造计算机时，对图灵的工作知之甚少，他的动机是让查尔斯·巴贝奇的分析引擎成为现实6。Mark I 的一个关键特性是它是全自动的，能够在无人干预的情况下运行数天6。这将成为未来计算机设计的一个基础特性。

Meanwhile, American engineers John Mauchly and Presper Eckert of the University of Pennsylvania designed and built the _Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer_ (ENIAC) in 1945. ENIAC is arguably the forerunner of modern computers. It was digital (though it used decimal rather than binary), fully electronic, programmable, and general purpose. While the original version of ENIAC did not have stored-program capabilities, this feature was built into it before the end of the decade. ENIAC was financed and built for the U.S. Army’s Ballistic Research Laboratory and was designed primarily to calculate ballistic trajectories. Later, it would be used to aid in the design of the hydrogen bomb.
与此同时，美国工程师宾夕法尼亚大学的约翰·莫奇利和普雷斯珀·埃克特于 1945 年设计并制造了电子数字积分计算机 (ENIAC)。ENIAC 可以说是现代计算机的前身。它是数字化的（尽管它使用十进制而不是二进制）、全电子化、可编程和通用的。虽然 ENIAC 的原始版本不具备存储程序功能，但此功能在 20 世纪 90 年代末之前就已内置。ENIAC 由美国陆军弹道研究实验室资助并建造，主要用于计算弹道轨迹。后来，它被用来辅助设计氢弹。

As men were drafted into the armed forces during World War II, women were hired to help in the war effort as human computers. With the arrival of the first electronic computers, women became the first programmers, as programming was considered secretarial work. It should come as no surprise that many of the early innovations in programming, such as the first compiler, the notion of modularizing programs, debugging, and assembly language, are credited to women inventors. Grace Hopper, for example, developed the first high-level and machine-independent programming language (COBOL) and its compiler. Hopper was also a programmer for the Mark I and wrote the book that described its operation.
第二次世界大战期间，男性被征召入伍，女性则被聘为人类计算机，为战争出力。随着第一台电子计算机的出现，女性成为第一批程序员，因为编程被认为是秘书工作。编程领域的许多早期创新，如第一个编译器、模块化程序的概念、调试和汇编语言，都归功于女性发明家，这并不奇怪。例如，格蕾丝·霍珀 (Grace Hopper) 开发了第一种高级且独立于机器的编程语言 (COBOL) 及其编译器。霍珀还是 Mark I 的程序员，并撰写了一本描述其操作的书。

The ENIAC programmers were six women: Jean Jennings Bartik, Betty Snyder Holberton, Kay McNulty Mauchly, Frances Bilas Spence, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, and Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum. Unlike the Wrens, the ENIAC women were given a great deal of autonomy in their task; given just the wiring diagrams of ENIAC, they were told to figure out how it worked and how to program it. In addition to their innovation in solving how to program (and debug) one of the world’s first electronic general-purpose computers, the ENIAC programmers also developed the idea of algorithmic flow charts, and developed important programming concepts such as subroutines and nesting. Like Grace Hopper, Jean Jennings Bartik and Betty Snyder Holberton would go on to have long careers in computing, and are some of the early computing pioneers. Unfortunately, the full extent of women’s contributions in early computing is not known. Unable to advance, many women left the field after World War II. To learn more about early women programmers, we encourage readers to check out _Recoding Gender_ 11 by Janet Abbate, _Top Secret Rosies_, a PBS documentary12 directed by LeAnn Erickson, and _"The Computers"_ by Kathy Kleiman13.
ENIAC 的程序员有六位女性：Jean Jennings Bartik、Betty Snyder Holberton、Kay McNulty Mauchly、Frances Bilas Spence、Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer 和 Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum。与 Wren 姐妹不同，ENIAC 的女性程序员在工作中拥有很大的自主权；她们只拿到了 ENIAC 的接线图，就被要求弄清楚它的工作原理和编程方法。除了在解决如何编程（和调试）世界上第一台电子通用计算机方面取得创新成果外，ENIAC 程序员还开发了算法流程图的概念，并开发了子程序和嵌套等重要的编程概念。与 Grace Hopper 一样，Jean Jennings Bartik 和 Betty Snyder Holberton 后来在计算机领域工作了很长时间，是早期计算机领域的先驱。不幸的是，女性在早期计算机领域做出的贡献尚不清楚。由于无法晋升，许多女性在二战后离开了这个领域。若要了解有关早期女性程序员的更多信息，我们鼓励读者阅读 Janet Abbate 的《重新编码性别》11、LeAnn Erickson 执导的 PBS 纪录片《绝密罗西斯》12 和 Kathy Kleiman 的《计算机》。13

The British and the Americans were not the only ones interested in the potential of computers. In Germany, Konrad Zuse developed the first electromechanical general-purpose digital programmable computer, the Z3, which was completed in 1941. Zuse came up with his design independently of the work of Turing and others. Notably, Zuse’s design used binary (rather than decimal), the first computer of its kind to use the binary system. However, the Z3 was destroyed during aerial bombing of Berlin, and Zuse was unable to continue his work until 1950. His work largely went unrecognized until years later. He is widely considered the father of computing in Germany.
英国人和美国人并不是唯一对计算机潜力感兴趣的人。在德国，康拉德·楚泽开发了第一台机电式通用数字可编程计算机 Z3，该计算机于 1941 年完成。楚泽的设计独立于图灵等人的工作。值得注意的是，楚泽的设计使用二进制（而不是十进制），这是第一台使用二进制系统的计算机。然而，Z3 在柏林空袭期间被毁，楚泽直到 1950 年才得以继续他的工作。他的工作直到多年后才被广泛认可。他被广泛认为是德国计算机之父。

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/hist.html#_so_what_did_von_neumann_know)5.1.3. So What Did von Neumann Know?什么事冯·诺依曼机器？

From our discussion of the origin of modern computer architecture, it is apparent that in the 1930s and 1940s there were several innovations that led to the rise of the computer as we know it today. In 1945, John von Neumann published a paper, "First draft of a report on the EDVAC"9, which describes an architecture on which modern computers are based. EDVAC was the successor of ENIAC. It differed from ENIAC in that it was a binary computer instead of decimal, and it was a stored-program computer. Today, this description of EDVAC’s architectural design is known as the _von Neumann architecture_.
从我们对现代计算机体系结构起源的讨论中可以看出，在 20 世纪 30 年代和 40 年代，有几项创新导致了我们今天所知的计算机的兴起。1945 年，约翰·冯·诺依曼发表了一篇论文《EDVAC 报告初稿》9，其中描述了现代计算机所基于的体系结构。EDVAC 是 ENIAC 的后继者。它与 ENIAC 的不同之处在于它是一台二进制计算机而不是十进制计算机，并且它是一台存储程序计算机。今天，对 EDVAC 架构设计的描述被称为 _冯·诺依曼架构_。

The **von Neumann architecture** describes a general-purpose computer, one that is designed to run any program. It also uses a stored-program model, meaning that program instructions and data are both loaded onto the computer to run. In the von Neumann model there is no distinction between instructions and data; both are loaded into the computer’s internal memory, and program instructions are fetched from memory and executed by the computer’s functional units that execute program instructions on program data.
**冯·诺依曼架构** 描述的是一种通用计算机，旨在运行任何程序。它还使用存储程序模型，这意味着程序指令和数据都被加载到计算机上运行。在冯·诺依曼模型中，指令和数据没有区别；两者都被加载到计算机的内部存储器中，程序指令从内存中取出并由计算机的功能单元执行，这些功能单元对程序数据执行程序指令。

John von Neumann’s contributions weave in and out of several of the previous stories in computing. A Hungarian mathematician, he was a professor at both the Institute of Advanced Study and Princeton University, and he served as an early mentor to Alan Turing. Later, von Neumann became a research scientist on the Manhattan Project, which led him to Howard Aiken and the Mark I; he would later serve as a consultant on the ENIAC project, and correspond regularly with Eckert and Mauchly. His famous paper describing EDVAC came from his work on the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC), proposed to the U.S. Army by Eckert and Mauchly, and built at the University of Pennsylvania. EDVAC included several architectural design innovations that form the foundation of almost all modern computers: it was general purpose, used the binary numeric system, had internal memory, and was fully electric. In large part because von Neumann was the sole author of the paper9, the architectural design the paper describes is primarily credited to von Neumann and has become known as the von Neumann architecture. It should be noted that Turing described in great detail the design of a similar machine in 1946. However, since von Neumann’s paper was published before Turing’s, von Neumann received the chief credit for these innovations.
约翰·冯·诺依曼的贡献与计算机领域的几位前辈的故事交织在一起。他是匈牙利数学家，曾担任高等研究院和普林斯顿大学的教授，也是艾伦·图灵的早期导师。后来，冯·诺依曼成为曼哈顿计划的研究科学家，这使他认识了霍华德·艾肯和 Mark I；他后来担任 ENIAC 项目的顾问，并定期与埃克特和莫奇利通信。他那篇描述 EDVAC 的著名论文来自他对电子离散变量自动计算机 (EDVAC) 的研究，该计算机由埃克特和莫奇利向美国陆军提出，并由宾夕法尼亚大学建造。EDVAC 包括几项架构设计创新，这些创新构成了几乎所有现代计算机的基础：它是通用的，使用二进制数字系统，有内部存储器，并且完全是电动的。很大程度上，由于冯·诺依曼是这篇论文的唯一作者9，论文中描述的架构设计主要归功于冯·诺依曼，并被称为冯·诺依曼架构。值得注意的是，图灵在 1946 年详细描述了类似机器的设计。然而，由于冯·诺依曼的论文发表于图灵之前，因此冯·诺依曼获得了这些创新的主要功劳。

Regardless of who "really" invented the von Neumann architecture, von Neumann’s own contributions should not be diminished. He was a brilliant mathematician and scientist. His contributions to mathematics range from set theory to quantum mechanics and game theory. In computing, he is also regarded as the inventor of the _merge sort_ algorithm. Walter Isaacson, in his book _The Innovators_, argued that one of von Neumann’s greatest strengths lay in his ability to collaborate widely and to intuitively see the importance of novel concepts6. A lot of the early designers of the computer worked in isolation from one another. Isaacson argues that by witnessing the slowness of the Mark I computer, von Neumann was able to intuitively realize the value of a truly electronic computer, and the need to store and modify programs in memory. It could therefore be argued that von Neumann, even more than Eckert and Mauchly, grasped and fully appreciated the power of a fully electronic stored-program computer6.
无论谁“真正”发明了冯·诺依曼架构，冯·诺依曼自己的贡献都不应被贬低。他是一位才华横溢的数学家和科学家。他对数学的贡献范围从集合论到量子力学和博弈论。在计算领域，他也被认为是归并排序算法的发明者。沃尔特·艾萨克森在他的《创新者》一书中指出，冯·诺依曼最大的优势之一在于他能够广泛合作，并直观地看到新概念的重要性6。许多早期的计算机设计师都是独立工作的。艾萨克森认为，通过目睹 Mark I 计算机的缓慢，冯·诺依曼能够直观地认识到真正电子计算机的价值，以及在内存中存储和修改程序的必要性。因此可以说，冯·诺依曼比埃克特和莫奇利更了解并充分认识到全电子存储程序计算机6的威力。
