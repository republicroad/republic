## 12.3. Memory Considerations

Programmers should pay special attention to memory use, especially when employing memory-intensive data structures such as matrices and arrays. Although compilers offer powerful optimization features, the compiler cannot always make optimizations that improve a program’s memory use. In this section, we use an implementation of a matrix-vector program ([matrixVector.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/_attachments/matrixVector.c)) to guide discussion of techniques and tools for improving memory use.

The `main` function of the program performs two steps. First, it allocates and initializes the input matrix, the input vector, and the output matrix. Next, it performs matrix-vector multiplication. Running the code on matrix-vector dimensions of 10,000 × 10,000 reveals that the `matrixVectorMultiply` function takes up the majority of the time:

```sh
$ gcc -o matrixVector matrixVector.c
$ ./matrixVector 10000 10000
Time to allocate and fill matrices: 1.2827
Time to allocate vector: 9.6e-05
Time to matrix-vector multiply: 1.98402
```

Our discussion will thus focus on the `matrixVectorMultiply` function.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/memory_considerations.html#_loop_interchange)12.3.1. Loop Interchange

Loop interchange optimizations switch the order of inner and outer loops in nested loops in order to maximize cache locality. Automatically performing this task is difficult for compilers to do. In GCC, the `-floop-interchange` compiler flag exists but is currently not available by default. Therefore, it is a good idea for programmers to pay attention to how their code is accessing memory-composite data structures like arrays and matrices. As an example, let’s take a closer look at the `matrixVectorMultiply` function in [matrixVector.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/_attachments/matrixVector.c):

Table 1. Loop interchange on the `matrixVectorMultiply()` function.

|---|---|
|```c<br>void matrixVectorMultiply(int **m,<br>                          int *v,<br>                          int **res,<br>                          int row,<br>                          int col) {<br>    int i, j;<br>    //cycles through every matrix column<br>    //in inner-most loop (inefficient)<br>    for (j = 0; j < col; j++){<br>        for (i = 0; i < row; i++){<br>            res[i][j] = m[i][j] * v[j];<br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br>```|```c<br>void matrixVectorMultiply(int **m,<br>                          int *v,<br>                          int **res,<br>                          int row,<br>                          int col) {<br>    int i, j;<br>    //cycles through every row of matrix<br>    //in inner-most loop<br>    for (i = 0; i < row; i++){<br>        for (j = 0; j < col; j++){<br>            res[i][j] = m[i][j] * v[j];<br>        }<br>    }<br>}<br>```|

The input and output matrices are dynamically allocated (second method discussed in C chapter). As a result, the rows in the matrices are not contiguous to one another, whereas the elements in every row are contiguous. The current ordering of the loops causes the program to cycle through each column instead of every row. Recall that [data is loaded into cache in _blocks_](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C11-MemHierarchy/caching.html#_direct_mapped_caches) not elements. As a result, when an element _x_ in an array in either `res` or `m` is accessed, the _elements adjacent to x_ are also loaded into cache. Cycling through every "column" of the matrix causes more cache misses, as the cache is forced to load new blocks with every access. [Table 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/memory_considerations.html#MatBench) shows that adding optimization flags does not decrease the runtime of the function. However, simply switching the order of the loops (as shown in the previous code examples and in [matrixVector2.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/_attachments/matrixVector2.c)) makes the function nearly eight times faster and allows the compiler to perform additional optimizations.

Table 2. Time in Seconds to Perform Matrix Multiplication on 10,000 × 10,000 Elements
|Version|Program|Unoptimized|`-O1`|`-O2`|`-O3`|

|Original|`matrixVector`|2.01|2.05|2.07|2.08|
|With Loop Interchange|`matrixVector2`|0.27|0.08|0.06|0.06|

The Valgrind tool `cachegrind` (discussed in [Chapter 11](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C11-MemHierarchy/cachegrind.html#_cache_analysis_and_valgrind)) is a great way to identify data locality issues, and reveals the cache access differences in the two versions of the `matrixVectorMultiply` function shown in the previous example.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/memory_considerations.html#_some_other_compiler_optimizations_for_improving_locality_fission_and_fusion)12.3.2. Some Other Compiler Optimizations for Improving Locality: Fission and Fusion

Rerunning the improved program on 10,000 × 10,000 elements yields the following runtime numbers:

```sh
$ gcc -o matrixVector2 matrixVector2.c
$ ./matrixVector2 10000 10000
Time to allocate and fill matrices: 1.29203
Time to allocate vector: 0.000107
Time to matrix-vector multiply: 0.271369
```

Now, matrix allocation and filling takes the most time. Additional timing reveals that it is the filling of the matrices that in fact takes the most time. Let’s take a closer look at that code:

```c
//fill matrices
for (i = 0; i < rows; i++){
    fillArrayRandom(matrix[i], cols);
    fillArrayZeros(result[i], cols);
}
```

To fill the input and output matrices, a `for` loop cycles through all the rows, and calls the `fillArrayRandom` and `fillArrayZeros` functions on each matrix. In some scenarios, it may be advantageous for the compiler to split the single loop into two separate loops (known as **loop fission**), as shown in [Table 3](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/memory_considerations.html#fission).

Table 3. Loop fission example on fill matrices for loop in `main`.
|Original Version|With loop fission|
|---|---|
|```c<br>for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {<br>    fillArrayRandom(matrix[i], cols);<br>    fillArrayZeros(result[i], cols);<br>}<br>```|```c<br>for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {<br>    fillArrayRandom(matrix[i], cols);<br>}<br><br>for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {<br>    fillArrayZeros(result[i], cols);<br>}<br>```|

The process of taking two loops that operate over the same range and combining their contents into a single loop (i.e., the opposite of loop fission) is called **loop fusion**. Loop fission and fusion are examples of optimizations a compiler might perform to try to improve data locality. Compilers for multicore processors may also use loop fission or fusion to enable loops to execute efficiently on multiple cores. For example, a compiler may use loop fission to assign two loops to different cores. Likewise, a compiler may use loop fusion to combine together dependent operations into the body of the loop and distribute to each core a subset of the loop iterations (assuming data between iterations are independent).

In our case, applying loop fission manually does not directly improve program performance; there is virtually no change in the amount of time required to fill the array. However, it may make clear a more subtle optimization: the loop containing `fillArrayZeros` is not necessary. The `matrixVectorMultiply` function assigns values to each element in the `result` array; a prior initialization to all zeros is unnecessary.

Table 4. Removing unneeded call to `fillArrayZeros`.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/memory_considerations.html#_memory_profiling_with_massif)12.3.3. Memory Profiling with Massif

Making the previous change results in only a slight decrease in runtime. Although it eliminates the step of filling in all elements in the result matrix with zeros, a significant amount of time is still required to fill the input matrix with random numbers:

```sh
$ gcc -o matrixVector3 matrixVector3.c
$ ./matrixVector3 10000 10000
Time to allocate matrices: 0.049073
Time to fill matrices: 0.946801
Time to allocate vector: 9.3e-05
Time to matrix-vector multiply: 0.359525
```

Even though each array is stored noncontiguously in memory, each one takes up 10,000 × `sizeof(int)` bytes, or 40,000 bytes. Because there is a total of 20,000 (10,000 each for the initial matrix and the result matrix) arrays allocated, this corresponds to 800 million bytes, or roughly 762 MB of space. Filling 762 MB with random numbers understandably takes a lot of time. With matrices, memory use increases quadratically with the input size, and can play a large role in performance.

Valgrind’s `massif` tool can help you profile memory use. Like the other Valgrind tools we covered in this book ([memcheck](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C3-C_debug/valgrind.html#_debugging_memory_with_valgrind), [cachegrind](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C11-MemHierarchy/cachegrind.html#_cache_analysis_and_valgrind), and [callgrind](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/basic.html#_using_callgrind_to_profile)), `massif` runs as a wrapper around a program’s executable. Specifically, `massif` takes snapshots of program memory use throughout the program, and profiles how memory usage fluctuates. Programmers may find the `massif` tool useful for tracking how their programs use heap memory, and for identifying opportunities to improve memory use. Let’s run the `massif` tool on the `matrixVector3` executable:

$ valgrind --tool=massif ./matrixVector3 10000 10000

Time to fill matrices: 4.31627
Time to allocate vector: 0.001015

==7030==

Running `massif` produces a `massif.out.xxxx` file, where `xxxx` is a unique id number. If you are typing along, type `ls` to reveal your corresponding massif file. In the example that follows, the corresponding file is `massif.out.7030`. Use the `ms_print` command to view the `massif` output:

$ ms_print massif.out.7030

At the top of the output is the memory use graph. The _x_-axis shows the number of instructions executed. The _y_-axis shows memory use. The graph above indicates that a total of 9.778 billion (Gi) instructions executed during our run of `matrixVector3`. During execution, `massif` took a total of 80 snapshots to measure use on the heap. Memory use peaked in the last snapshot (79). Peak memory use for the program was 763.3 MB, and stayed relatively constant throughout the program.

Summaries of all the snapshots occur after the graph. For example, the following table corresponds to the snapshots around snapshot 79:

Each row corresponds to a particular snapshot, the time it was taken, the total heap memory consumption (in bytes) at that point, the number of bytes requested by the program ("useful-heap") at that point, the number of bytes allocated in excess of what the program asked for, and the size of the stack. By default, stack profiling is off (it slows `massif` down significantly). To enable stack profiling, use the `--stacks=yes` option when running `massif`.

The `massif` tool reveals that 99.96% of the program’s heap memory use occurred in the `allocateArray` function and that a total of 800 million bytes were allocated, consistent with the back-of-the-envelope calculation we performed earlier. Readers will likely find `massif` a useful tool for identifying areas of high heap memory use in their programs, which often slows a program down. For example, **memory leaks** can occur in programs when programmers frequently call `malloc` without calling `free` at the first correct opportunity. The `massif` tool is incredibly useful for detecting such leaks.
