## 14.4. Measuring the Performance of Parallel Programs

So far, we have used the `gettimeofday` function to measure the amount of time it takes for programs to execute. In this section, we discuss how to measure how well a parallel program performs in comparison to a serial program as well as other topics related to measuring the performance of parallel programs.

We first cover some basics related to parallel performance:

- [Speedup](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C14-SharedMemory/performance_basics.html#_speedup)
    
- [Efficiency](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C14-SharedMemory/performance_basics.html#_efficiency)
    
- [Amdahl’s Law](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C14-SharedMemory/performance_basics.html#_amdahls_law)
    

While Amdahl’s Law and speedup are two very important concepts related to performance, having a good understanding of the following topics will round out a reader’s understanding of performance:

- [Gustafson-Barsis Law](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C14-SharedMemory/performance_advanced.html#_gustafson_barsis_law)
    
- [Scalability](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C14-SharedMemory/performance_advanced.html#_scalability)
    

Specifically, the Gustafson-Barsis Law gives a better understanding of the limits of Amdahl’s Law.
