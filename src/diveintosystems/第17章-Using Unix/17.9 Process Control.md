## 17.9. Process Control

When you run a program or command at the shell prompt, the shell usually creates a new process that will run the program or command (a process is the operating systems abstraction of a running program). There are a few **built-in shell commands** that the shell process executes itself (e.g., `cd`), but most are run as separate processes. See [Chapter 13: The Operating System](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/index.html#_the_operating_system) for more information about processes.

The unix shell supports **process control** features, which are ways to specify how a program is run by the shell, and ways to interact with the process as it runs.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix2/pskill.html#_running_in_the_foreground_and_background)17.9.1. Running in the foreground and background

When a program is run at the shell prompt, it **runs in the foreground** by default, meaning that the program runs to completion before the shell program runs again and prints out the next prompt. However, programs can also be **run in the background**, meaning that the shell starts the program running but does not wait until it completes before printing out the next prompt; this allows a user to enter another command while the program is still running. To tell the shell to run a program in the background, the user adds an `&` at the end of the command line. For example, here is how to tell the shell to run an `a.out` program in the background:

$ ./a.out &
$

The `ps` command can be used to list all the programs running in the shell. For example, here we start two `a.out` programs running in the background, and then type `ps`:

$ ./a.out &
$ ./a.out &
$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 2729   pts/72    0:03.91 bash
 3582   pts/72    0:00.00 ./a.out
 3583   pts/72    0:00.00 ./a.out
 3584   pts/72    0:00.00 ps

In the example output, you can see two `a.out` processes are running in addition to the Bash shell process and the `ps` process. With each process is listed its `process id`, a unique identifier the the operating system keeps for each process (i.e., the `bash` process id is `2729` and the two processes running the `a.out` program have process ids `3582` and `3583`).

A process running in the background can be moved to the foreground using the `fg` command:

$ ./a.out &     # run a.out in the background
$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 2729   pts/72    0:03.91 bash
 3584   pts/72    0:00.00 ./a.out

$ fg           # move a.out to the foreground (the shell waits for it to exit)

$ ps           # run ps at the shell prompt (a.out has exited)
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 2729   pts/72    0:03.91 bash

By typing `CTRL-Z` a process running in the foreground can be interrupted and suspended meaning that its execution is paused (it is not running). This causes the shell to run again and print out a shell prompt. If the user types `bg`, the suspended process will continue running, but now run in the background. If the user types `fg` the suspended process will continue running in the foreground again. Here are some examples:

$ ./a.out     # run a.out in the foreground
              # type CTRL-Z to suspend a.out
[1]  Stopped                 ./a.out

$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 2729   pts/72    0:03.91 bash
 3588   pts/72    0:00.00 ./a.out

$ bg         # unsuspend a.out and run in background

$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 2729   pts/72    0:03.91 bash
 3588   pts/72    0:00.00 ./a.out

$ fg        # run backgrounded process in the foreground

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix2/pskill.html#_killing_a_running_processes)17.9.2. Killing a running processes

The `kill` and `pkill` commands are used to send a signal from the shell process to another processes. Signals are a way in which one process can notify another process to do something. Every signal triggers a default behavior, exiting or ignoring are two common default options (see [Chapter 13: The Operating System](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/index.html#_the_operating_system) for more information about signals).

The `kill` command takes the process id (PID) of the process to send the signal, and the `pkill` command takes the name of the command or executable file to which to send the signal (`pkill` sends the signal to all running processes with the specified name that are owned by the user running `pkill`). Both `kill` and `pkill` take an optional command line argument that species the specific signal to send to the process. Without specifying the specific signal, both default to sending a termination signal (`SIGTERM`) to the specified process(s).

A common use of these commands is to send a process a signal to tell it to exit (this is where `kill` gets its unfortunate name). Note that a process running in the foreground also can be killed by typing `CTRL-C`, which sends the process running in the foreground a `SIGINT` signal that by default tells the process to exit.

Here is an example call to `pkill` to kill all `a.out` processes:

$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3032597 pts/72   00:00:00 bash
3033074 pts/72   00:00:04 a.out
3033076 pts/72   00:00:03 a.out
3033089 pts/72   00:00:02 a.out
3033105 pts/72   00:00:00 ps

$ pkill a.out
[1]   Terminated              ./a.out
[2]-  Terminated              ./a.out
[3]+  Terminated              ./a.out

$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3032597 pts/72   00:00:00 bash
3033128 pts/72   00:00:00 ps

Here is an example call to `kill` to kill a specific `a.out` processes given its PID (the second process in the first `ps` listing):

$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3032597 pts/72   00:00:00 bash
3033870 pts/72   00:00:03 a.out
3033883 pts/72   00:00:02 a.out
3033886 pts/72   00:00:01 a.out
3033897 pts/72   00:00:00 ps

$ kill 3033883
[2]-  Terminated              ./a.out

$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3032597 pts/72   00:00:00 bash
3033870 pts/72   00:00:18 a.out
3033886 pts/72   00:00:16 a.out
3033974 pts/72   00:00:00 ps

Note that `kill` only killed the specific process with a matching pid value and not every process running the same program (`a.out`).

In both of these examples, we are not specifying the signal to send. Without any optional command line options, `kill` and `pkill` send the process the terminate signal (`SIGTERM` or signal number `15`). By default, `SIGTERM` tells the signaled process to exit. Sometimes you will see calls to `kill` and `pkill` that include a different signal number. In this case the signal number is specified as a command line argument (``-<signal number>'). For example, we could have included the signal number `-9`` to send them the `SIGKILL` signal (yet another way to tell a process to exit):

$ pkill -9 a.out
$ kill -9 3033883

In general, these commands can be used to send any signal to a process. For example, to send a process a `SIGALRM` signal (which is signal number `14`), you could do this:

$ kill -14 3033883

If the process doesn’t have a signal handler for the `SIGALRM` signal, the default behavior is that the `SIGALRM` signal is just ignored.

The man page for `signal` lists the minimal set of signals (and their signal numbers) that are defined in the system: `man 7 signal`.
