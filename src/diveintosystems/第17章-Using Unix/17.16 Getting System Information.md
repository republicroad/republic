## 17.16. Getting System Information

There are many tools available for obtaining information about the system’s state: `top` and `htop` provide dynamic summary information about system resources and resource use, such as CPU and memory use; and the `/proc` and `/sys` pseudo file systems contain detailed information about the current state of the system (there are also commands like `lscpu`, `lsmem`, and `lsgpu` that display some information from `/proc` and `/sys` in an easier to read form).

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix2/sysinfo.html#_top_and_htop)17.16.1. top and htop

Running `top` or `htop` at the command line provides dynamic summary information about the state of the system. Typing `q` quits `top` and `htop`. Both show memory and CPU usage information, but `htop` displays some of the usage statistics more graphically than `top` does, particularly showing memory usage and each core’s CPU utilization as a graph. Both also, by default, list information about the tasks currently using the most CPU time. A task is the Linux generic term for either a process or a thread, These tools update every second as they run, showing changes in summary system use data. Note that as the display updates every second, the ordering of processes will change as they execute according to how much CPU time they are using. Both are also very configurable to display different information about processes and system state.

[Figure 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix2/sysinfo.html#FigHOP) shows an example screenshot from `htop`.

Figure 1. Example htop screenshot).

At the very top, `htop` displays the current CPU usage of each of the 12 cores on this system as a usage graph annotated with percentages, followed the current memory usage (`Mem`), summary information about the average CPU load (`Load average`), the total number of tasks (`Tasks`) and threads (`thr`) running in the system, and information about swap partition usage (`Swp`). Under these is a listing of the tasks using the most CPU time in the systems. Note that in [Figure 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix2/sysinfo.html#FigHOP) the top five tasks listed are processes running the `a.out` infinite loop program, and thus they are unsurprisingly using up a lot of CPU time. At the bottom of the display are function keys for changing the data presented in different ways.

The `top` program displays very similar data to `htop` (but without the graphical displays at the top), and it similarly provides an interface to change the data presented in different ways as it runs. For example, users can view the CPU usage per core in `top` by hitting the “1” key.

In addition to being very configurable when running, both `top` and `htop` have a large number of command line options to configure what they show and how they show it. For example, by default `top` does not show per-thread statistics (only per-process), but by running with the `-H` command line option it will.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix2/sysinfo.html#_proc_and_sys)17.16.2. /proc and /sys

`/proc` and `/sys` are pseudo file systems that provide access to operating system information about process running in the system and to information about system state and resources (e.g., devices, buses, memory, cpu). A **pseudo file system** looks like a file system and can be interacted with via the filesystem interface, but it doesn’t actually store file data. Instead, through pseudo files in `/proc` and `/sys` a user can interact with the operating system; reading from pseudo files in `/proc` and `/sys` (e.g., `cat /proc/filename`) is a way to obtain information about system state from the OS. Some files in `/proc` and `/sys` can also be written to, which can trigger the OS to change a policy or change the state associated with a particular process or resource in the system. For example, a debugger like GDB may write into a `/proc` file associated with the process it is debugging to set a breakpoint, or it may read from a `/proc` file to examine the current contents of its stack memory.

Below are a few examples of the type of information that can be obtained from reading files in `/proc`. In our section on [caching on multicore processors](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C11-MemHierarchy/coherency.html#_looking_ahead_caching_on_multicore_processors) we show some examples of how to get information about CPU caches from files in `/sys`.

Each process running in the system has a subdirectory in `/proc` named with its process ID that contains many pseudo files that are interfaces to the process’s state and status. For example, suppose we want to get some information from `/proc` about the `a.out` process running in the background like this:

$ ./a.out &

We first get its process ID by running the `ps` command:

$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 246477 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
 246541 pts/0    00:01:59 a.out
 246879 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

We can then use file system commands to get information about the running `a.out` program using its process ID `246541` (and note that you can only access subdirectories in `/proc` associated with processes that you own). For example:

$ ls /proc/246541/         # list all pseudo files for this process

$ cat /proc/246541/comm    # list its executable file name
$ cat /proc/246541/status  # list its status information

The `status` pseudo file lists a lot of information, including the following:

State: R (running)  # its state: running, blocked, exited, ...
VmStk: 132 kB       # size of its stack (in its virtual memory (Vm))
nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches:  59593   # context switches due to OS CPU scheduling

This example `a.out` program contains an infinite loop; as it continues to run, the number of context switches increases, and its state will always be `R` (for running), until it is killed with `CTRL-C`.

Pseudo files in `/proc` (and in `/sys`) can also be used to get information from the OS about system-wide resources. Here are some examples of getting information from `/proc` (in the Memory Hierarchy chapter we show an example of getting [caching on multicore processors](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C11-MemHierarchy/coherency.html#_looking_ahead_caching_on_multicore_processors) from `/sys`):

cat /proc/meminfo    # info about system memory and its current use
cat /proc/cpuinfo    # info about each hyperthreaded core
cat /proc/swaps      # info about swap partitions and their use
cat /proc/stat       # lots of system statistics

Linux provides utilities that summarize some information in `/proc` and `/sys` in a form that is often easier to read than the output from directly reading files in `/proc` and `/sys`. The `lshw`, `lscpu`, and `lsgpu` are example commands that list information about the system hardware, the CPU, and GPU devices on a machine.

For example, to find the number of physical cores on a machine a user cat run `lscpu`:

CPU(s):                          32
On-line CPU(s) list:             0-31
Thread(s) per core:              2
Core(s) per socket:              8
Socket(s):                       2

The output shows that there are a total of 16 physical cores on the machine (2 Sockets/chips, and 8 cores per socket/chip). It also shows that each core is dual-hyperthreaded (2 `Thread(s) per core`), to make the 16-core machine appear to the operating system a 32-core machine. Please note that newer Intel architectures introduce P-cores and E-cores. For these architectures, the total listed CPU(s) may be higher than the number of physical cores multiplied by the number of sockets and hardware threads.
