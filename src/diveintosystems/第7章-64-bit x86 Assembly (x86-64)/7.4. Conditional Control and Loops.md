## 7.4. Conditional Control and Loops

This section covers x86 assembly instructions forÂ [conditionals and loops](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C1-C_intro/conditionals.html#_conditionals_and_loops). Recall that conditional statements enable coders to modify program execution based on the result of a conditional expression. The compiler translates conditionals into assembly instructions that modify the instruction pointer (`%rip`) to point to an address that is not the next one in the program sequence.
