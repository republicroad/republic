## 3.7. 总结

This chapter concludes our coverage of the C programming language. Compared to other high-level programming languages, C is a relatively small programming language with a few basic constructs from which a programmer builds their program. Because C language abstractions are closer to the underlying machine code executed by the computer, a C programmer can write code that runs much more efficiently than equivalent code written using the higher-level abstractions provided by other programming languages. In particular, a C programmer has much more control over how their program uses memory, which can have a significant impact on the program’s performance. C is the language of computer systems programming where low-level control and efficiency are crucial.

In subsequent chapters we use C examples to illustrate how a computer system is designed to run a program.

本章总结了我们对 C 编程语言的介绍。与其他高级编程语言相比，C 是一种相对较小的编程语言，具有一些程序员构建程序的基本结构。由于 C 语言抽象更接近计算机执行的底层机器代码，因此 C 程序员可以编写比使用其他编程语言提供的高级抽象编写的等效代码运行效率更高的代码。特别是，C 程序员对其程序如何使用内存有更多的控制权，这会对程序的性能产生重大影响。 C 是计算机系统编程语言，其中低级控制和效率至关重要。

在后续章节中，我们使用 C 示例来说明计算机系统是如何设计来运行程序的。
