## 13.6. Exercises

### Exercises for 13.2: Processes

1. Consider the code snippet below with calls to fork (and with error handling code removed just for readability sake):
    

```c
    pid_t ret;

    printf("A\n");

    ret = fork();
    if(ret == 0) {
        printf("B\n");

        ret = fork();
        if(ret == 0) {
            printf("C\n");
        }
        printf("D\n");
    } else {
        printf("E\n");

        ret = fork();
        printf("F\n");
    }

    printf("G\n");
```

1. Draw the process hierarchy created by executing this code.
    
2. For each process in the hierarchy, indicate its output sequence (the order in which it executes printf’s).
