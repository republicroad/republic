In addition to the standard arithmetic operations described earlier, CPUs also support operations that are uncommon outside of binary. These **bitwise operators** directly apply the behavior of [logic gates](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#_basic_logic_gates) to bit sequences, making them straightforward to implement efficiently in hardware. Unlike addition and subtraction, which programmers typically use to manipulate a variable’s numerical interpretation, programmers commonly use bitwise operators to modify specific bits in a variable. For example, a program might encode a certain bit position in a variable to hold a true/false meaning, and bitwise operations allow the program to manipulate the variable’s individual bits to change that specific bit.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#_bitwise_and)4.6.1. Bitwise AND

The bitwise AND operator (`&`) evaluates two input bit sequences. For each digit of the inputs, it outputs a 1 in the corresponding position of the output if _both_ inputs are 1 in that position. Otherwise, it outputs a 0 for the digit. [Table 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#TabANDTruth) shows the truth table for the bitwise AND of two values, _A_ and _B_.

Table 1. The Results of Bitwise ANDing Two Values (_A_ AND _B_)

|A|B|A & B|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|0|
|1|0|0|
|1|1|1|

For example, to bitwise AND 0b011010 with 0b110110, start by lining up the two sequences. Checking vertically through each digit, set the result of the column to 1 if _both_ digits are 1. Otherwise, set the result of the column to 0:

        011010
    AND 110110  Only digits 1 and 4 are 1's in BOTH inputs, so
Result: 010010  those are the only digits set to 1 in the output.

To perform a bitwise AND in C, place C’s bitwise AND operator (`&`) between two operand variables. Here’s the same example again, performed in C:

```c
int x = 26;
int y = 54;

printf("Result: %d\n", x & y);  // Prints 18
```

||Bitwise Operations versus Logical Truth Operations<br><br>Be careful not to conflate bitwise operators with [logical truth operators](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C1-C_intro/conditionals.html#_boolean_values_in_c). Despite having similar names (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), the two _are not_ the same:<br><br>- Bitwise operators consider each bit of their inputs independently and produce an output bit sequence as a function of the specific input bits that are set.<br>    <br>- Logical operators consider only the _truth_ interpretation of their operands. To C, a value of zero is _false_, whereas all other values are considered _true_. Logical operators are often used when evaluating conditionals (e.g., `if` statements).<br>    <br><br>Note that C often uses similar (but slightly different) operators to distinguish between the two. For example, you can indicate bitwise AND and bitwise OR using a single `&` and `\|`, respectively. Logical AND and logical OR correspond to a double `&&` and `\|`. Finally, bitwise NOT uses `~`, whereas logical NOT is expressed by `!`.|

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#_bitwise_or)4.6.2. Bitwise OR

The bitwise OR operator (`|`) behaves like the bitwise AND operator except that it outputs a 1 for a digit if _either or both_ of the inputs is 1 in the corresponding position. Otherwise, it outputs a 0 for the digit. [Table 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#TabORTruth) shows the truth table for the bitwise OR of two values, _A_ and _B_.

Table 2. The Results of Bitwise ORing Two Values (_A_ OR _B_)

|A|B|A \| B|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|1|

For example, to bitwise OR 0b011010 with 0b110110, start by lining up the two sequences. Checking vertically through each digit, set the result of the column to 1 if _either_ digit is 1:

        011010
     OR 110110     Only digit 0 contains a 0 in both inputs, so it's
Result: 111110     the only digit not set to 1 in the result.

To perform a bitwise OR in C, place C’s bitwise OR operator (`|`) between two operands. Here’s the same example again, performed in C:

```c
int x = 26;
int y = 54;

printf("Result: %d\n", x | y);  // Prints 62
```

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#_bitwise_xor_exclusive_or)4.6.3. Bitwise XOR (Exclusive OR)

The bitwise XOR operator (`^`) behaves like the bitwise OR operator except that it outputs a 1 for a digit only if _exactly one_ (but not both) of the inputs is 1 in the corresponding position. Otherwise, it outputs a 0 for the digit. [Table 3](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#TabXORTruth) shows the truth table for the bitwise XOR of two values, _A_ and _B_.

Table 3. The Results of Bitwise XORing Two Values (_A_ XOR _B_)

|A|B|A ^ B|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|

For example, to bitwise XOR 0b011010 with 0b110110, start by lining up the two sequences. Checking vertically through each digit, set the result of the column to 1 if _only one_ digit is 1:

        011010
    XOR 110110     Digits 2, 3, and 6 contain a 1 in exactly one of
Result: 101100     the two inputs.

To perform a bitwise XOR in C, place C’s bitwise XOR operator (`^`) between two operands. Here’s the same example again, performed in C:

```c
int x = 26;
int y = 54;

printf("Result: %d\n", x ^ y);  // Prints 44
```

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#_bitwise_not)4.6.4. Bitwise NOT

The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) operates on just one operand. For each bit in the sequence, it simply flips the bit such that a zero becomes a one or vice versa. [Table 4](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#TabNOTTruth) shows the truth table for the bitwise NOT operator.

Table 4. The Results of Bitwise NOTing a Value (_A_)

|A|~ A|
|---|---|
|0|1|
|1|0|

For example, to bitwise NOT 0b011010, invert the value of each bit:

    NOT 011010
Result: 100101

To perform a bitwise NOT in C, place a tilde character (`~`) in front of an operand. Here’s the same example again, performed in C:

```c
int x = 26;

printf("Result: %d\n", ~x); // Prints -27
```

|   |   |
|---|---|
||Bitwise NOT vs. Negation<br><br>Note that all modern systems represent integers using two’s complement, so bitwise NOT isn’t quite the same as negation. Bitwise NOT _only_ flips the bits and _doesn’t_ add one.|

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#_bit_shifting)4.6.5. Bit Shifting

Another important bitwise operation involves shifting the position of an operand’s bits either to the left (`<<`) or to the right (`>>`). Both the left and right shifting operators take two operands: the bit sequence to shift and the number of places it should be shifted.

#### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#_shifting_left)Shifting Left

Shifting a sequence to the left by _N_ places moves each of its bits to the left _N_ times, appending new zeros to the right side of the sequence. For example, shifting the eight-bit sequence 0b00101101 to the left by two produces 0b101101**00**. The two zeros at the right are appended to end of the sequence, since the result still needs to be an eight-bit sequence.

In the absence of overflow, shifting to the left _increases_ the value of the result because bits move toward digits that contribute larger powers of two to the value of the number. However, with a fixed number of bits, any bits that shift into positions beyond the maximum capacity of the number get truncated. For example, shifting the eight-bit sequence 0b11110101 (unsigned interpretation 245) to the left by one produces 0b1110101**0** (unsigned interpretation 234). Here, the truncation of the high-order bit that shifted out makes the result smaller.

To perform a left bit shift in C, place two less-than characters (`<<`) between a value and the number of places to shift that value:

```c
int x = 13;  // 13 is 0b00001101

printf("Result: %d\n", x << 3);  // Prints 104 (0b01101000)
```

#### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/bitwise.html#_shifting_right)Shifting Right

Shifting to the right is similar to left shifting — any bits that are shifted out of a variable’s capacity (e.g., off the end to the right) disappear due to truncation. However, right shifting introduces an additional consideration: the new bits prepended to the left side of the result may need to be either all zeros or all ones depending on the _type_ of the variable being shifted and its high-order bit value. Conceptually, the choice to prepend zeros or ones resembles that of [sign extension](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/signed.html#_sign_extension). Thus, there exist two distinct variants of right shifting:

- A **logical right shift** always prepends zeros to the high-order bits of the result. Logical shifting is used to shift _unsigned_ variables, since a leading 1 in the most significant bit of an unsigned value isn’t intended to mean that the value is negative. For example, shifting 0b10110011 to the right by two using a logical shift yields 0b**00**101100.
    
- An **arithmetic right shift** prepends a copy of the shifted value’s most significant bit into each of the new bit positions. Arithmetic shifting applies to _signed_ variables, for which it’s important to preserve the signedness of the high-order bits. For example, shifting 0b10110011 to the right by two using an arithmetic shift yields 0b**11**101100.
    

Fortunately, when programming in C, you don’t typically need to worry about the distinction if you’ve declared your variables properly. If your program includes a right shift operator (`>>`), virtually every C compiler will automatically perform the appropriate type of shifting according to the type of the shifting variable. That is, if the shifting variable was declared with the _unsigned_ qualifier, the compiler will perform a logical shift. Otherwise, it will perform an arithmetic shift.

|     | C Right Shift Example Program<br><br>You can test the behavior of right shifting with a small example program like this one:<br><br>```c<br>#include <stdio.h><br><br>int main(int argc, char **argv) {<br>    /* Unsigned integer value: u_val. */<br>    unsigned int u_val = 0xFF000000;<br><br>    /* Signed integer value: s_val. */<br>    int s_val = 0xFF000000;<br><br>    printf("%08X\n", u_val >> 12);  // logical right shift<br>    printf("%08X\n", s_val >> 12);  // arithmetic right shift<br><br>    return 0;<br>}<br>```<br><br>This program declares two 32-bit integers: one as an unsigned integer (`u_val`), and another as a signed integer (`s_val`). It initializes both integers to the same starting value: a sequence of eight ones followed by 24 zeros (`0b1111111100000000000000000000000000`), and then it shifts both values 12 positions to the right. When executed, it prints:<br><br>$ ./a.out<br>000FF000<br>FFFFF000<br><br>Because a leading 1 doesn’t indicate "negative" for the unsigned `u_val`, the compiler uses instructions to prepend it with only zeros. The shifted result contains 12 zeros, eight ones, and 12 more zeros (`0b00000000000011111111000000000000`). On the other hand, the leading 1 **does** indicate "negative" for `s_val`, so the compiler prepends 1’s to the front of the shifted value, yielding 20 ones followed by 12 zeros (`0b11111111111111111111000000000000`). |
