## 16.3. Conditionals and Loops

[Table 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/conditionals.html#TabJavaIfElseComparison) shows that the syntax and semantics of `if`-`else` statements in C and Java are the same.

Table 1. Syntax Comparison of if-else Statements in Java and C

|Java version|C version|
|---|---|
|```java<br>/* Java if-else example */<br><br>import java.util.Scanner;<br><br>class IfExample {<br><br> public static void  main(String[] args) {<br><br>   int n1, n2;<br>   Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);<br><br>   System.out.print("Enter 1st num: ");<br>   n1 = in.nextInt();<br>   System.out.print("Enter 2nd num: ");<br>   n2 = in.nextInt();<br><br>   if (n1 > n2) {<br>     System.out.printf("%d is biggest\n",n1);<br>     n2 = n1;<br>   } else {<br>     System.out.printf("%d is biggest\n",n2);<br>     n1 = n2;<br>   }<br> }<br><br>}<br>```|```c<br>/* C if-else example */<br><br>#include <stdio.h><br><br><br><br>int main(void) {<br><br>  int n1, n2;<br><br><br>  printf("Enter 1st num: ");<br>  scanf("%d", &n1);<br>  printf("Enter 2nd num: ");<br>  scanf("%d", &n2);<br><br>  if (n1 > n2) {<br>    printf("%d is biggest\n",n1);<br>    n2 = n1;<br>  } else {<br>    printf("%d is biggest\n",n2);<br>    n1 = n2;<br>  }<br><br>  return 0;<br>}<br>```|

The Java and C syntax for `if`-`else` statements is identical. In both, the `else` part is optional. Java and C also support multi-way branching by chaining `if` and `else if` statements. The following describes the full `if`-`else` C syntax:

```c
    // a one-way branch:
    if ( <boolean expression> ) {
        <true body>
    }

    // a two-way branch:
    if ( <boolean expression> ) {
        <true body>
    }
    else {
        <false body>
    }

    // a multibranch (chaining if-else if-...-else)
    // (has one or more 'else if' following the first if):
    if ( <boolean expression 1> ) {
        <true body>
    }
    else if ( <boolean expression  2> ) {
        // first expression is false, second is true
        <true 2 body>
    }
    else if ( <boolean expression  3> ) {
        // first and second expressions are false, third is true
        <true 3 body>
    }
    // ... more else if's ...
    else if ( <boolean expression  N> ) {
        // first N-1 expressions are false, Nth is true
        <true N body>
    }
    else { // the final else part is optional
        // if all previous expressions are false
        <false body>
    }
```

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/conditionals.html#_boolean_values_in_c)16.3.1. Boolean Values in C

C doesn’t provide a Boolean type with true or false values. Instead, integer values evaluate to **true** or **false** when used in conditional statements. When used in conditional expressions, any integer expression that is:

- **zero (0)** evaluates to **false**
    
- **nonzero (any positive or negative value)** evaluates to **true**
    

C has a set of relational and logical operators for Boolean expressions that are identical to Java’s relational and logical operators.

The **relational operators** take operand(s) of the same type and evaluate to zero (false) or nonzero (true). The set of relational operators are:

- equality (`==`) and inequality (not equal, `!=`)
    
- comparison operators: less than (`<`), less than or equal (`<=`), greater than (`>`), and greater than or equal (`>=`)
    

Here are some C code snippets showing examples of relational operators:

```c
// assume x and y are ints, and have been assigned
// values before this point in the code

if (y < 0) {
    printf("y is negative\n");
} else if (y != 0) {
    printf("y is positive\n");
} else {
    printf("y is zero\n");
}

// set x and y to the larger of the two values
if (x >= y) {
    y = x;
} else {
    x = y;
}
```

C’s **logical operators** take integer "Boolean" operand(s) and evaluate to either zero (false) or nonzero (true). The set of logical operators are:

- logical negation (`!`)
    
- logical and (`&&`): stops evaluating at the first false expression (short-circuiting)
    
- logical or (`||`): stops evaluating at the first true expression (short-circuiting)
    

C’s **short-circuit** logical operator evaluation stops evaluating a logical expression as soon as the result is known. For example, if the first operand to a logical and (`&&`) expression evaluates to false, the result of the `&&` expression must be false. As a result, the second operand’s value need not be evaluated, and it is not evaluated.

The following is an example of conditional statements in C that use logical operators (it’s always best to use parentheses around complex Boolean expressions to make them easier to read):

```c
if ( (x > 10) && (y >= x) ) {
    printf("y and x are both larger than 10\n");
    x = 13;
} else if ( ((-x) == 10) || (y > x) ) {
    printf("y might be bigger than x\n");
    x = y * x;
} else {
    printf("I have no idea what the relationship between x and y is\n");
}
```

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/conditionals.html#_loops_in_c)16.3.2. Loops in C

Java and C both have language-level support for repeating a sequence of code. Like Java, C supports `for`, `while`, and `do`-`while` loops. The syntax and semantics of these are identical in both languages. Java additionally has support for iterating over collections that C does not have.

#### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/conditionals.html#_while_loops)while Loops

The `while` loop syntax in C and Java is identical, and the behavior is the same. [Table 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/conditionals.html#TabWhileLoop) shows an example C program with a `while` loop.

Table 2. while Loop Syntax in C

|C while loop example|
|---|
|```c<br>/* C while loop example */<br><br>#include <stdio.h><br><br>int main(void) {<br><br>    int num, val;<br><br>    printf("Enter a value: ");<br>    scanf("%d", &num);<br>    // make sure num is not negative<br>    if (num < 0) {<br>        num = -num;<br>    }<br>    val = 1;<br>    while (val < num) {<br>        printf("%d\n", val);<br>        val = val * 2;<br>    }<br><br>    return 0;<br>}<br>```|

The `while` loop syntax in C is the same as in Java and both are evaluated in the same way:

```c
while ( <boolean expression> ) {
    <true body>
}
```

The `while` loop checks the Boolean expression first and executes the body if true. In the preceding example program, the value of the `val` variable will be repeatedly printed in the `while` loop until its value is greater than the value of the `num` variable. If the user enters `10`, the C and Java programs will print:

1
2
4
8

Java and C also has a `do`-`while` loop that is similar to its `while` loop, but it executes the loop body first and then checks a condition and repeats executing the loop body for as long as the condition is true. That is, a `do`-`while` loop will always execute the loop body at least one time:

```c
do {
    <body>
} while ( <boolean expression> );
```

For additional `while` loop examples, try these two programs:

- [whileLoop1.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/_attachments/whileLoop1.c)
    
- [whileLoop2.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/_attachments/whileLoop2.c)
    

#### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/conditionals.html#_for_loops)for Loops

The `for` loop in C is the same as the `for` loop in Java, and they are evaluated in the same way. The C (and Java) `for` loop syntax is:

```c
for ( <initialization>; <boolean expression>; <step> ) {
    <body>
}
```

The `for` loop evaluation rules are:

1. Evaluate _initialization_ one time when first entering the loop.
    
2. Evaluate the _boolean expression_. If it’s 0 (false), drop out of the `for` loop (that is, the program is done repeating the loop body statements).
    
3. Evaluate the statements inside the loop _body_.
    
4. Evaluate the _step_ expression.
    
5. Repeat from step (2).
    

Here’s a simple example `for` loop to print the values 0, 1, and 2:

```c
int i;

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

Executing the `for` loop evaluation rules on the preceding loop yields the following sequence of actions:

(1) eval init: i is set to 0  (i=0)
(2) eval bool expr: i < 3 is true
(3) execute loop body: print the value of i (0)
(4) eval step: i is set to 1  (i++)
(2) eval bool expr: i < 3 is true
(3) execute loop body: print the value of i (1)
(4) eval step: i is set to 2  (i++)
(2) eval bool expr: i < 3 is true
(3) execute loop body: print the value of i (2)
(4) eval step: i is set to 3  (i++)
(2) eval bool expr: i < 3 is false, drop out of the for loop

The following program shows a more complicated `for` loop example (it’s also [available to download](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/_attachments/forLoop2.c)). Note that just because C supports `for` loops with a list of statements for its _initialization_ and _step_ parts, it’s best to keep it simple (this example illustrates a more complicated `for` loop syntax, but the `for` loop would be easier to read and understand if it were simplified by moving the `j += 10` step statement to the end of the loop body and having just a single step statement, `i += 1`).

```c
/* An example of a more complex for loop which uses multiple variables.
 * (it is unusual to have for loops with multiple statements in the
 * init and step parts, but C supports it and there are times when it
 * is useful...don't go nuts with this just because you can)
 */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int i, j;

    for (i=0, j=0; i < 10; i+=1, j+=10) {
        printf("i+j = %d\n", i+j);
    }

    return 0;
}

// the rules for evaluating a for loop are the same no matter how
// simple or complex each part is:
// (1) evaluate the initialization statements once on the first
//     evaluation of the for loop:  i=0 and j=0
// (2) evaluate the boolean condition: i < 10
//     if false (when i is 10), drop out of the for loop
// (3) execute the statements inside the for loop body: printf
// (4) evaluate the step statements:  i += 1, j += 10
// (5) repeat, starting at step (2)
```

As in Java, in C `for` loops and `while` loops are equivalent in power, meaning that any `while` loop can be expressed as a `for` loop, and vice versa.

Consider the following `while` loop in C:

```c
int guess = 0;

while (guess != num) {
    printf("%d is not the right number\n", guess);
    printf("Enter another guess: ");
    scanf("%d", &guess);
}
```

This loop can be translated to an equivalent `for` loop in C:

```c
int guess;

for (guess = 0; guess != num; ) {
    printf("%d is not the right number\n", guess);
    printf("Enter another guess: ");
    scanf("%d", &guess);
}
```

Because `for` and `while` loops are equally expressive in C, only one looping construct is needed in the language. However, `for` loops are a more natural language construct for definite loops (like iterating over a range of values), whereas `while` loops are a more natural language construct for indefinite loops (like repeating until the user enters an even number). As a result, C (and Java) provides both to programmers.
