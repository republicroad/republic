## 17.11. Command History

The `history` command lists the recent history of commands that have been run by the shell. Sometimes it can be useful for a user to see commands that have been run in the past. For example, to remember the specific command line arguments they used to a program. It also allows a user to re-execute commands with a special shorthand notation to re-run a specific command from the shell’s history.

Here is an example run of the `history` command:

$ history
    35	8:17	ls
    36	8:17	cd classes/CS31
    37  8:17    echo "hi Sam"
    38	8:17	./a.out infile.txt outfile.txt &
    39	8:18	./a.out &
    40	8:18	ps
    41	8:18	pkill a.out
    42	8:18	ps
    43	8:18	history

This example shows a series of a few commands run in the shell’s recent history. With each command in the history is a number indicating its position in the history and the time the command was started. The most recently run command was the 43nd command, `history`. To re-run a command from the history, you can use `!` followed by the number of the command, and `!!` runs the most recent previous command again. This is particularly useful for easily re-running commands that have a long list of command line arguments. For example, to re-run command `37` from the history (`echo "hi Sam"`), a user just needs to type `!37` at the shell prompt:

$ !37
hi Sam
$ history
    35	8:17	ls
    36	8:17	cd classes/CS31
    37  8:17    echo "hi Sam"
    38	8:17	./a.out infile.txt outfile.txt &
    39	8:18	./a.out &
    40	8:18	ps
    41	8:18	pkill a.out
    42	8:18	ps
    43	8:18	history
    44  8:20    echo "hi Sam"
    45	8:20	history

Note that `!37` does not show up in the history, but that command number `44` from the history lists the same command line as command line `37`, the one that was re-run by entering `37!`.
