## 13.2. Processes

One of the main abstractions implemented by the operating system is a **process**. A process represents an instance of a program running in the system, which includes the program’s binary executable code, data, and execution **context**. The context tracks the program’s execution by maintaining its register values, stack location, and the instruction it is currently executing.

Processes are necessary abstractions in **multiprogramming** systems, which support multiple processes existing in the system at the same time. The process abstraction is used by the OS to keep track of individual instances of programs running in the system, and to manage their use of system resources.

The OS provides each process with a "lone view" abstraction of the system. That is, the OS isolates processes from one another and gives each process the illusion that it’s controlling the entire machine. In reality, the OS supports many active processes and manages resource sharing among them. The OS hides the details of sharing and accessing system resources from the user, and the OS protects processes from the actions of other processes running in the system.

For example, a user may simultaneously run two instances of a Unix shell program along with a web browser on a computer system. The OS creates three processes associated with these three running programs: one process for each separate execution of the Unix shell program, and one process for the web browser. The OS handles switching between these three processes running on the CPU, and it ensures that as a process runs on the CPU, only the execution state and system resources allocated to the process can be accessed.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#_multiprogramming_and_context_switching)13.2.1. Multiprogramming and Context Switching

Multiprogramming enables the OS to make efficient use of hardware resources. For example, when a process running on the CPU needs to access data that are currently on disk, rather than have the CPU sit idle waiting for the data to be read into memory, the OS can give the CPU to another process and let it run while the read operation for the original process is being handled by the disk. By using multiprogramming, the OS can mitigate some of the effects of the memory hierarchy on its program workload by keeping the CPU busy executing some processes while other processes are waiting to access data in the lower levels of the memory hierarchy.

General-purpose operating systems often implement **timesharing**, which is multiprogramming wherein the OS schedules each process to take turns executing on the CPU for short time durations (known as a **time slice** or **quantum**). When a process completes its time slice on the CPU, the OS removes the process from the CPU and lets another run. Most systems define time slices to be a few milliseconds (10-3 seconds), which is a long time in terms of CPU cycles but is not noticeable to a human.

Timesharing systems further support the "lone view" of the computer system to the user; because each process frequently executes on the CPU for short bursts of time, the fact that they are all sharing the CPU is usually imperceptible to the user. Only when the system is very heavily loaded might a user notice the effects of other processes in the system. The Unix command `ps -A` lists all the processes running in the system — you may be surprised by how many there are. The `top` command is also useful for seeing the state of the system as it runs by displaying the set of processes that currently use the most system resources (such as CPU time and memory space).

In multiprogrammed and timeshared systems, processes run **concurrently**, meaning that their executions overlap in time. For example, the OS may start running process A on the CPU, and then switch to running process B for a while, and later switch back to running process A some more. In this scenario, processes A and B run concurrently because their execution on the CPU overlaps due to the OS switching between the two.

#### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#_context_switching)Context Switching

The **mechanism** behind multiprogramming determines how the OS swaps one process running on the CPU with another. The **policy** aspect of multiprogramming governs scheduling the CPU, or picking which process from a set of candidate processes gets to use the CPU next and for how long. We focus primarily on the mechanism of implementing multiprogramming. Operating systems textbooks cover scheduling policies in more detail.

The OS performs **context switching**, or swapping process state on the CPU, as the primary mechanism behind multiprogramming (and timesharing). There are two main steps to performing a CPU context switch:

1. The OS saves the context of the current process running on the CPU, including all of its register values (PC, stack pointers, general-purpose register, condition codes, etc.), its memory state, and some other state (for example the state of system resources it uses, like open files).
    
2. The OS restores the saved context from another process on the CPU and starts the CPU running this other process, continuing its execution from the instruction where it left off.
    

One part of context switching that may seem impossible to accomplish is that the OS’s code that implements context switching must run on the CPU while it saves (restores) a process’s execution contexts from (to) the CPU; the instructions of the context switching code need to use CPU hardware registers to execute, but the register values from the process being context switched off the CPU need to be saved by the context switching code. Computer hardware provides some help to make this possible.

At boot time, the OS initialized the hardware, including initializing the CPU state, so that when the CPU switches to kernel mode on an interrupt, the OS interrupt handler code starts executing and the interrupted process’s execution state is protected from this execution. Together, the computer hardware and OS perform some of the initial saving of the user-level execution context, enough that the OS code can run on the CPU without losing the execution state of the interrupted process. For example, register values of the interrupted process need to be saved so that when the process runs again on the CPU, the process can continue from the point at which it left off, using its register values. Depending on the hardware support, saving the user-level process’s register values may be done entirely by the hardware or may be done almost entirely in software as the first part of the kernel’s interrupt handling code. At a minimum, the process’s program counter (PC) value needs to be saved so that its value is not lost when the kernel interrupt handler address is loaded into the PC.

Once the OS starts running, it executes its full process context switching code, saving the full execution state of the process running on the CPU and restoring the saved execution state of another process onto the CPU. Because the OS runs in kernel mode it is able to access any parts of computer memory and can execute privileged instructions and access any hardware registers. As a result, its context switching code is able to access and save the CPU execution state of any process to memory, and it is able to restore from memory the execution state of any process to the CPU. OS context switching code completes by setting up the CPU to execute the restored process’s execution state and by switching the CPU to user mode. Once switched to user mode, the CPU executes instructions, and uses execution state, from the process that the OS context switched onto the CPU.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#_process_state)13.2.2. Process State

In multiprogrammed systems, the OS must track and manage the multiple processes existing in the system at any given time. The OS maintains information about each process, including:

- A **process id** (PID), which is a unique identifier for a process. The `ps` command lists information about processes in the system, including their PID values.
    
- The address space information for the process.
    
- The execution state of the process (e.g., CPU register values, stack location).
    
- The set of resources allocated to the process (e.g., open files).
    
- The current **process state**, which is a value that determines its eligibility for execution on the CPU.
    

Over the course of its lifetime, a process moves through several states, which correspond to different categories of process execution eligibility. One way that the OS uses process state is to identify the set of processes that are candidates for being scheduled on the CPU.

The set of process execution states are:

- **Ready**: The process could run on the CPU but is not currently scheduled (it is a candidate for being context switched on to the CPU). Once a new process is created and initialized by the OS, it enters the ready state (it is ready for the CPU to start executing its first instruction). In a timesharing system, if a process is context switched off the CPU because its time slice is up, it is also placed in the _ready_ state (it is ready for the CPU to execute its next instruction, but it used up its time slice and has to wait its turn to get scheduled again on the CPU).
    
- **Running**: The process is scheduled on the CPU and is actively executing instructions.
    
- **Blocked**: The process is waiting for some event before it can continue being executed. For example, the process is waiting for some data to be read in from disk. Blocked processes are not candidates for being scheduled on the CPU. After the event on which the process is blocked occurs, the process moves to the _ready_ state (it is ready to run again).
    
- **Exited**: The process has exited but still needs to be completely removed from the system. A process exits due to its completing the execution of its program instructions, or by exiting with an error (e.g., it tries to divide by zero), or by receiving a termination request from another process. An exited process will never run again, but it remains in the system until final clean-up associated with its execution state is complete.
    

[Figure 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#FigProcState) shows the lifetime of a process in the system, illustrating how it moves between different states. Note the transitions (arrows) from one state to another. For example, a process can enter the _Ready_ state in one of three ways: first, if it is newly created by the OS; second, if it was blocked waiting for some event and the event occurs; and third, if it was running on the CPU and its time slice is over and the OS context switches it off to give another _Ready_ process its turn on the CPU.

Process Runtime

Programmers often use a process’s completion time as a metric to evaluate its performance. For noninteractive programs, a faster runtime typically indicates a better, or more optimal, implementation. For example, in comparing two programs that compute the prime factors of a large number, the one that correctly completes the task faster is preferable.

There are two different measures of the runtime of a process. The first is total **wall time** (or wall-clock time). Wall time is the duration between the start and completion of a process it is the elapsed time from the process’s start to finish as measured by a clock hanging on a wall. Wall time includes the time that the process is in the Running state executing on the CPU, as well as time that the process is in the Blocked state waiting for an event like I/O, as well as time that the process spends in the Ready state waiting for its turn to be scheduled to run on the CPU. In multiprogrammed and timeshared systems, the wall time of a process can slow down due to other processes running concurrently on the system and sharing system resources.

The second measure of process runtime is total **CPU time** (or process time). CPU time measures just the amount of time the process spends in the Running state executing its instructions on the CPU. CPU time does not include the time the process spends in the Blocked or Ready states. As a result, a process’s total CPU time is not affected by other processes concurrently running on the system.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#_creating_and_destroying_processes)13.2.3. Creating (and Destroying) Processes

An OS creates a new process when an existing process makes a system call requesting it to do so. In Unix, the **fork** system call creates a new process. The process calling `fork` is the **parent** process and the new process it creates is its **child** process. For example, if you run `a.out` in a shell, the shell process calls the `fork` system call to request that the OS create a new child process that will be used to run the `a.out` program. Another example is a web browser process that calls `fork` to create child processes to handle different browsing events. A web browser may create a child process to handle communication with a web server when a user loads a web page. It may create another process to handle user mouse input, and other processes to handle separate browser windows or tabs. A multiple-process web browser like this is able to continue handling user requests through some of its child browser processes, while at the same time some of its other child browser processes may be blocked waiting for remote web server responses or for user mouse clicks.

A **process hierarchy** of parent-child relationships exists between the set of processes active in the system. For example, if process _A_ makes two calls to `fork`, two new child processes are created, _B_ and C_. If process _C_ then calls `fork`, another new process, _D_, will be created. Process _C_ is the child of _A_, and the parent of _D_. Processes _B_ and _C_ are siblings (they share a common parent process, process _A_). Process _A_ is the ancestor of _B_, _C_, and _D_. This example is illustrated in [Figure 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#phierarchyex).

![Process Hierarchy created from the example.  A is the top ancestor with two children, B and C below it.  C has one child, D, below it.](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/_images/prochierarchy.png)

Figure 2. An example process hierarchy created by a parent process (A) calling fork twice to create two child processes (B and C). C’s call to fork creates its child process, D. To list the process hierarchy on Linux systems, run `pstree`, or `ps -Aef --forest`.

Since existing processes trigger process creation, a system needs at least one process to create any new processes. At boot time, the OS creates the first user-level process in the system. This special process, named `init`, sits at the very top of the process hierarchy as the ancestor of all other processes in the system.

#### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#_fork)fork

The `fork` system call is used to create a process. At the time of the fork, the child inherits its execution state from its parent. The OS creates a _copy_ of the calling (parent) process’s execution state at the point when the parent calls `fork`. This execution state includes the parent’s address space contents, CPU register values, and any system resources it has allocated (e.g., open files). The OS also creates a new **process control struct**, an OS data structure for managing the child process, and it assigns the child process a unique PID. After the OS creates and initializes the new process, the child and parent are concurrent — they both continue running and their executions overlap as the OS context switches them on and off the CPU.

When the child process is first scheduled by the OS to run on the CPU, it starts executing at the point at which its parent left off — at the return from the `fork` call. This is because `fork` gives the child a copy of its parent’s execution state (the child executes using its own copy of this state when it starts running). From the programmer’s point of view, _a call to `fork` returns twice_: once in the context of the running parent process, and once in the context of the running child process.

In order to differentiate the child and parent processes in a program, a call to `fork` returns different values to the parent and child. The child process always receives a return value of 0, whereas the parent receives the child’s PID value (or -1 if `fork` fails).

For example, the following code snippet shows a call to the `fork` system call that creates a new child process of the calling process:

```c
pid_t pid;

pid = fork();   /* create a new child process */

print("pid = %d\n", pid);  /* both parent and child execute this */
```

After the call to `fork` creates a new child process, the parent and child processes both continue executing, in their separate execution contexts, at the return point of the `fork` call. Both processes assign the return value of `fork` to their `pid` variable and both call `printf`. The child process’s call prints out 0 and the parent process prints out the child’s PID value.

[Figure 3](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#justfork) shows an example of what the process hierarchy looks like after this code’s execution. The child process gets an exact copy of the parent process’s execution context at the point of the fork, but the value stored in its variable `pid` differs from its parent because `fork` returns the child’s PID value (14 in this example) to the parent process, and 0 to the child.

![forked child process gets copy of parent state, but fork returns a different value to the child and parent process](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/_images/fork.png)

Figure 3. A process (PID 12) calls fork to create a new child process. The new child process gets an exact copy of its parent’s address and execution state, but gets its own process identifier (PID 14). fork returns 0 to the child process and the child’s PID value (14) to the parent.

Often, the programmer wants the child and parent processes to perform different tasks after the `fork` call. A programmer can use the different return values from `fork` to trigger the parent and child processes to execute different code branches. For example, the following code snippet creates a new child process and uses the return value from `fork` to have the child and parent processes execute different code branches after the call:

```c
pid_t pid;

pid = fork();   /* create a new child process */

if (pid == 0) {
    /* only the child process executes this code */
    ...
} else if (pid != -1)  {
    /* only the parent process executes this code */
    ...
}
```

It is important to remember that as soon as they are created, the child and parent processes run concurrently in their own execution contexts, modifying their separate copies of program variables and possibly executing different branches in the code.

Consider the [following program](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/_attachments/fork.c) that contains a call to `fork` with branching on the value of `pid` to trigger the parent and child processes to execute different code (this example also shows a call to `getpid` that returns the PID of the calling process):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void) {

    pid_t pid, mypid;

    printf("A\n");

    pid = fork();   /* create a new child process */

    if(pid == -1) {  /* check and handle error return value */
        printf("fork failed!\n");
        exit(pid);
    }

    if (pid == 0) { /* the child process */
        mypid = getpid();
        printf("Child: fork returned %d, my pid %d\n", pid, mypid);

    } else  {  /* the parent process */
        mypid = getpid();
        printf("Parent: fork returned %d, my pid %d\n", pid, mypid);
    }

    printf("B:%d\n", mypid);

    return 0;
}
```

When run, this program’s output might look like the following (assume that the parent’s PID is 12 and the child’s is 14):

```
A
Parent: fork returned 14, my pid 12
B:12
Child: fork returned 0, my pid 14
B:14
```

In fact, the program’s output could look like any of the possible options shown in [Table 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#TabParentChildOrderings) (and you will often see more than one possible ordering of output if you run the program multiple times). In [Table 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#TabParentChildOrderings), the parent prints B:12 and the child B:14 in this example, but the exact PID values will vary from run to run.

Table 1. All Six Possible Orderings of Example Program Output
|Option 1|Option 2|Option 3|Option 4|Option 5|Option 6|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|`A`|`A`|`A`|`A`|`A`|`A`|
|`Parent…​`|`Parent…​`|`Parent…​`|`Child…​`|`Child…​`|`Child…​`|
|`Child…​`|`Child…​`|`B:12`|`Parent…​`|`Parent…​`|`B:14`|
|`B:12`|`B:14`|`Child…​`|`B:12`|`B:14`|`Parent…​`|
|`B:14`|`B:12`|`B:14`|`B:14`|`B:12`|`B:12`|

These six different output orderings are possible because after the `fork` system call returns, the parent and child processes are concurrent and can be scheduled to run on the CPU in many different orderings, resulting in any possible interleaving of their instruction sequences. Consider the execution time line of this program, shown in [Figure 4](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#forktime). The dotted line represents concurrent execution of the two processes. Depending on when each is scheduled to run on the CPU, one could execute both its `printf` statements before the other, or the execution of their two `printf` statements could be interleaved, resulting in any of the possible outcomes shown in the table above. Because only one process, the parent, exists before the call to `fork`, A is always printed by the parent before any of the output after the call to `fork`.

![after the parent calls fork, both processes execute concurrently](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/_images/forkprint.png)

Figure 4. The execution time line of the program. Only the parent process exists before the call to `fork`. After `fork` returns, both run concurrently (shown in the dotted lines).

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#_exec)13.2.4. exec

Usually a new process is created to execute a program that is different from that of its parent process. This means that `fork` is often called to create a process with the intention of running a new program from its starting point (that is starting its execution from its first instruction). For example, if a user types `./a.out` in a shell, the shell process forks a new child process to run `a.out`. As two separate processes, the shell and the `a.out` process are protected from each other; they cannot interfere with each other’s execution state.

While `fork` creates the new child process, it does not cause the child to run `a.out`. To initialize the child process to run a new program, the child process calls one of the **exec** system calls. Unix provides a family of exec system calls that trigger the OS to overlay the calling process’s image with a new image from a binary executable file. In other words, an exec system call tells the OS to overwrite the calling process’s address space contents with the specified `a.out` and to reinitialize its execution state to start executing the very first instruction in the `a.out` program.

One example of an exec system call is `execvp`, whose function prototype is as follows:

```c
int execvp(char *filename, char *argv[]);
```

The `filename` parameter specifies the name of a binary executable program to initialize the process’s image, and `argv` contains the command line arguments to pass into the `main` function of the program when it starts executing.

Here’s an example code snippet that, when executed, creates a new child process to run `a.out`:

```c
pid_t pid;
int  ret;
char *argv[2];

argv[0] = "a.out";  // initialize command line arguments for main
argv[1] = NULL;

pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
    ret = execvp("a.out", argv);
    if (ret < 0) {
        printf("Error: execvp returned!!!\n");
        exit(ret);
    }
}
```

The `argv` variable is initialized to the value of the `argv` argument that is passed to the `main` function of `a.out`:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv) { ...
```

`execvp` will figure out the value to pass to `argc` based on this `argv` value (in this case 1).

[Figure 5](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#FigExec) shows what the process hierarchy would look like after executing this code:

![after fork child calls exec](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/_images/exec.png)

Figure 5. When the child process calls execvp (left), the OS replaces its image with a.out (right) and initializes the child process to start running the a.out program from its beginning.

Something to note in the example code shown above is its seemingly odd error message after the call to `execvp`: why would returning from an exec system call be an error? If the exec system call is successful, then the error detection and handling code immediately following it will never be executed because the process will now be executing code in the `a.out` program instead of this code (the process’s address space contents have been changed by exec). That is, when a call to an exec function is successful, the process doesn’t continue its execution at the return of the exec call. Because of this behavior, the following code snippet is equivalent to the one shown above (however, the one above is typically easier to understand):

```c
pid_t pid;
int ret;

pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
    ret = execvp("a.out", argv);
    printf("Error: execvp returned!!!\n");  /* only executed if execvp fails */
    exit(ret);
}
```

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#_exit_and_wait)13.2.5. exit and wait

To terminate, a process calls the `exit` system call, which triggers the OS to clean up most of the process’s state. After running the exit code, a process notifies its parent process that it has exited. The parent is responsible for cleaning up the exited child’s remaining state from the system.

Processes can be triggered to exit in several ways. First, a process may complete all of its application code. Returning from its `main` function leads to a process invoking the `exit` system call. Second, a process can perform an invalid action, such as dividing by zero or dereferencing a null pointer, that results in its exiting. Finally, a process can receive a **signal** from the OS or another process, telling it to exit (in fact, dividing by zero and NULL pointer dereferences result in the OS sending the process `SIGFPE` and `SIGSEGV` signals telling it to exit).

Signals

A **signal** is a software interrupt that the OS delivers to a process. Signals are a method by which related processes can communicate with one another. The OS provides an interface for one process to send a signal to another, and for it to communicate with processes (to send a process a `SIGSEGV` signal when it dereferences a null pointer, for example).

When a process receives a signal, it is interrupted to run special signal handler code. A system defines a fixed number of signals to communicate various meanings, each differentiated by a unique signal number. The OS implements default signal handlers for each signal type, but programmers can register their own user-level signal handler code to override the default actions of most signals for their application.

The [Signals](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/ipc_signals.html#_signals) section contains more information about signals and signal handling.

If a shell process wants to terminate its child process running `a.out`, it can send the child a `SIGKILL` signal. When the child process receives the signal, it runs signal handler code for `SIGKILL` that calls `exit`, terminating the child process. If a user types CTRL-C in a Unix shell that is currently running a program, the child process receives a `SIGINT` signal. The default signal handler for `SIGINT` also calls `exit`, resulting in the child process exiting.

After executing the `exit` system call, the OS delivers a `SIGCHLD` signal to the process’s parent process to notify it that its child has exited. The child becomes a **zombie** process; it moves to the Exited state and can no longer run on the CPU. The execution state of a zombie process is partially cleaned up, but the OS still maintains a little information about it, including about how it terminated.

A parent process **reaps** its zombie child (cleans up the rest of its state from the system) by calling the `wait` system call. If the parent process calls `wait` before its child process exits, the parent process blocks until it receives a `SIGCHLD` signal from the child. The `waitpid` system call is a version of `wait` that takes a PID argument, allowing a parent to block while waiting for the termination of a specific child process.

[Figure 6](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#FigExit) shows the sequence of events that occur when a process exits.

![child exits](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/_images/exit.png)

Figure 6. Process exit. Left: The child process calls the exit system call to clean up most of its execution state. Middle: After running exit, the child process becomes a zombie (it is in the Exited state and cannot run again), and its parent process is sent a SIGCHLD signal, notifying it that its child is exited. Right: The parent calls waitpid to reap its zombie child (cleans up the rest of the child’s state from the system).

Because the parent and child processes execute concurrently, the parent may call `wait` before its child exits, or the child can exit before the parent calls `wait`. If the child is still executing when the parent process calls `wait`, the parent blocks until the child exits (the parent enters the Blocked state waiting for the `SIGCHLD` signal event to happen). The blocking behavior of the parent can be seen if you run a program (`a.out`) in the foreground of a shell — the shell program doesn’t print out a shell prompt until `a.out` terminates, indicating that the shell parent process is blocked on a call to `wait`, waiting until it receives a `SIGCHLD` from its child process running `a.out`.

A programmer can also design the parent process code so that it will never block waiting for a child process to exit. If the parent implements a `SIGCHLD` signal handler that contains the call to `wait`, then the parent only calls `wait` when there is an exited child process to reap, and thus it doesn’t block on a `wait` call. This behavior can be seen by running a program in the background in a shell (`a.out &`). The shell program will continue executing, print out a prompt, and execute another command as its child runs `a.out`. Here’s an example of how you might see the difference between a parent blocking on `wait` vs. a nonblocking parent that only calls `wait` inside a `SIGCHLD` signal handler (make sure you execute a program that runs for long enough to notice the difference):

$  a.out        # shell process forks child and calls wait

$  a.out &      # shell process forks child but does not call wait
$  ps           # (the shell can run ps and a.out concurrently)

Below is an example code snippet containing `fork`, `exec`, `exit`, and `wait` system calls (with error handling removed for readability). This example is designed to test your understanding of these system calls and their effects on the execution of the processes. In this example, the parent process creates a child process and waits for it to exit. The child then forks another child to run the `a.out` program (the first child is the parent of the second child). It then waits for its child to exit.

```c
pid_t pid1, pid2, ret;
int status;

printf("A\n");

pid1 = fork();
if (pid1 == 0 ) {       /* child 1 */
    printf("B\n");

    pid2 = fork();
    if (pid2 == 0 ){    /* child 2 */
        printf("C\n");
        execvp("a.out", NULL);
    } else {            /* child 1 (parent of child 2) */
        ret = wait(&status);
        printf("D\n");
        exit(0);
    }
} else {                /* original parent */
    printf("E\n");
    ret = wait(&status);
    printf("F\n");
}
```

[Figure 7](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#FigForkWait) illustrates the execution time line of process create/running/blocked/exit events from executing the above example. The dotted lines represent times when a process’s execution overlaps with its child or descendants: the processes are concurrent and can be scheduled on the CPU in any order. Solid lines represent dependencies on the execution of the processes. For example, Child 1 cannot call `exit` until it has reaped its exited child process, Child 2. When a process calls `wait`, it blocks until its child exits. When a process calls `exit`, it never runs again. The program’s output is annotated along each process’s execution time line at points in its execution when the corresponding `printf` statement can occur.

Figure 7. The execution time line for the example program, showing a possible sequence of fork, exec, wait, and exit calls from the three processes. Solid lines represent dependencies in the order of execution between processes, and dotted line concurrent execution points. Parent is the parent process of Child 1, and Child 1 is the parent of Child 2.

After the calls to `fork` are made in this program, the parent process and first child process run concurrently, thus the call to `wait` in the parent could be interleaved with any instruction of its child. For example, the parent process could call `wait` and block before its child process calls `fork` to create its child process. [Table 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#TabOutputs) lists all possible outputs from running the example program.

Table 2. All Possible Output Orderings from the Program
|Option 1|Option 2|Option 3|Option 4|
|---|---|---|---|
|`A`|`A`|`A`|`A`|
|`B`|`B`|`B`|`E`|
|`C`|`C`|`E`|`B`|
|`D`|`E`|`C`|`C`|
|`E`|`D`|`D`|`D`|
|`F`|`F`|`F`|`F`|

The program outputs in [Table 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C13-OS/processes.html#TabOutputs) are all possible because the parent runs concurrently with its descendant processes until it calls `wait`. Thus, the parent’s call to `printf("E\n")` can be interleaved at any point between the start and the exit of its descendant processes.
