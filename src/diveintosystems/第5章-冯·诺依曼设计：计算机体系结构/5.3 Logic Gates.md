## 5.3. Logic Gates

**Logic gates** are the building blocks of the digital circuitry that implements arithmetic, control, and storage functionality in a digital computer. Designing complicated digital circuits involves employing a high degree of abstraction: a designer creates simple circuits that implement basic functionality from a small set of basic logic gates; these simple circuits, abstracted from their implementation, are used as the building blocks for creating more complicated circuits (simple circuits are combined together to create new circuits with more complicated functionality); these more complicated circuits may be further abstracted and used as a building block for creating even more complicated functionality; and so on to build complete processing, storage, and control components of a processor.

Transistors

Logic gates are created from transistors that are etched into a semiconductor material (e.g. silicon chips). Transistors act as switches that control electrical flow through the chip. A transistor can switch its state between on or off (between a high or low voltage output). Its output state depends on its current state plus its input state (high or low voltage). Binary values are encoded with these high (1) and low (0) voltages, and logic gates are implemented by arrangements of a few transistors that perform switching actions on the inputs to produce the logic gate’s output. The number of transistors that can fit on an integrated circuit (a chip) is a rough measure of its power; with more transistors per chip, there are more building blocks to implement more functionality or storage.

At the lowest level, all circuits are built from linking logic gates together. Logic gates implement boolean operations on boolean operands (0 or 1). **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** form a complete set of logic gates from which any circuit can be constructed. A logic gate has one (NOT) or two (AND and OR) binary input values and produces a binary output value that is the bitwise logical operation on its input. For example, an input value of 0 to a NOT gate outputs 1 (1 is NOT(0)). A **truth table** for a logical operation lists the operation’s value for each permutation of inputs. [Table 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#basiclogicops) shows the truth tables for the AND, OR, and NOT logic gates.

Table 1. Truth Tables for Basic Logic Operations.

|A|B|A AND B|A OR B|NOT A|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|0|1|
|0|1|0|1|1|
|1|0|0|1|0|
|1|1|1|1|0|

[Figure 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#FIGandornot) shows how computer architects represent these gates in circuit drawings.

Figure 1. The AND, OR, and NOT logic gates for single-bit inputs produce a single-bit output.

A multi-bit version of a logic gate (for _M_-bit input and output) is a very simple circuit constructed using _M_ one-bit logic gates. Individual bits of the _M_-bit input value are each input into a different one-bit gate that produces the corresponding output bit of the _M_-bit result. For example, [Figure 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#FIG4bitand) shows a 4-bit AND circuit built from four 1-bit AND gates.

This type of very simple circuit, one that just expands input and output bit width for a logic gate, is often referred to as an _M_-bit gate for a particular value of _M_ specifying the input and output bit width (number of bits).

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#_other_logic_gates)5.3.2. Other Logic Gates

Even though the set of logic gates consisting of AND, OR, and NOT is sufficient for implementing any circuit, there are other basic logic gates that are often used to construct digital circuits. These additional logic gates include NAND (the negation of A AND B), NOR (the negation of A OR B), and XOR (exclusive OR). Their truth tables are shown in [Table 2](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#nandnorxorTT).

Table 2. NAND, NOR, XOR truth tables.

|A|B|A NAND B|A NOR B|A XOR B|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|0|1|1|0|
|0|1|1|0|1|
|1|0|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|0|0|

The NAND, NOR, and XOR gates appear in circuit drawings, as shown in [Figure 3](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#Fignandnorxor).

Figure 3. The NAND, NOR, and XOR logic gates.

The circle on the end of the NAND and NOR gates represents negation or NOT. For example, the NOR gate looks like an OR gate with a circle on the end, representing the fact that NOR is the negation of OR.

Minimal subsets of logic gates

NAND, NOR, and XOR are not necessary for building circuits, but they are additional gates added to the set {AND, OR, NOT} that are commonly used in circuit design. Any of these gates can be implemented from transistors (the building block of logic gates), or can be implemented from combinations of other gates.

Of the larger set {AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR}, there exist several minimal subsets of logic gates that alone are sufficient for building any circuit. For example, the subset {AND, NOT} is one minimal subset: (A OR B) is equivalent to NOT(NOT(A) AND NOT(B)). Rather than using a minimal subset of gates, we we use the set {AND, OR, NOT} because it is the easiest set to understand.

Because NAND, NOR, and XOR are not necessary, their functionality can be implemented by combining AND, OR, and NOT gates into circuits that implement NAND, NOR, and XOR functions. For example, NOR can be built using a NOT combined with an OR gate, `(A NOR B) ≡ NOT(A OR B)`), as shown in [Figure 4](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/gates.html#Fignorasnotor).

![NOR built from OR and NOT gates: OR output is input to NOT gate](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C5-Arch/_images/nornotor.png)

Figure 4. The NOR gate can be implemented using an OR and a NOT gate. The inputs, A and B, are first fed through an OR gate, and the OR gate’s output is input to a NOT gate (NOR is the NOT of OR).

Today’s integrated circuits chips are built using CMOS technology, which uses NAND as the basic building block of circuits on the chip. The NAND gate by itself makes up another minimal subset of complete logic gates.
