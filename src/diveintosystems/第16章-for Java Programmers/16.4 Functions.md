## 16.4. Functions

One of the main differences between Java and C is that C is an imperative and procedural language and Java is an object oriented language. In C, programs are organized as one or more functions. Every C program must have at least a `main` function, but often has many other functions. In Java a program is organized as a set of objects that interact. Class definitions define the state and methods of objects as well as static definitions and methods that are associated with the class. There are no functions in Java that are outside of class definitions. A Java program that consists of a single class with no data members and only `public static` method functions is most similar in design to a C program.

Functions break code into manageable pieces and reduce code duplication. Functions might take zero or more **parameters** as input and they **return** a single value of a specific type. A function **declaration** or **prototype** specifies the function’s name, its return type, and its parameter list (the number and types of all the parameters). A function **definition** includes the code to be executed when the function is called. All functions in C must be declared before they’re called. This can be done by declaring a function prototype or by fully defining the function before calling it:

// function definition format:
// ---------------------------
<return type> <function name> (<parameter list>)
{
    <function body>
}

// parameter list format:
// ---------------------
<type> <param1 name>, <type> <param2 name>, ...,  <type> <last param name>

Here’s an example function definition. Note that the comments describe what the function does, the details of each parameter (what it’s used for and what it should be passed), and what the function returns:

```c
/* This program computes the larger of two
 * values entered by the user.
 */
#include <stdio.h>

/* max: computes the larger of two integer values
 *   x: one integer value
 *   y: the other integer value
 *   returns: the larger of x and y
 */
int max(int x, int y) {
    int bigger;

    bigger = x;
    if (y > x) {
        bigger = y;
    }
    printf("  in max, before return x: %d y: %d\n", x, y);
    return bigger;
}
```

Functions that don’t return a value should specify the `void` return type. Here’s an example of a `void` function:

```c
/* prints out the squares from start to stop
 *   start: the beginning of the range
 *   stop: the end of the range
 */
void print_table(int start, int stop) {
    int i;

    for (i = start; i <= stop; i++) {
        printf("%d\t", i*i);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

As in any programming language that supports functions or procedures, a **function call** invokes a function, passing specific argument values for the particular call. A function is called by its name and is passed arguments, with one argument for each corresponding function parameter. In C, calling a function looks like this:

```
// function call format:
// ---------------------
function_name(<argument list>);


// argument list format:
// ---------------------
<argument 1 expression>, <argument 2 expression>, ...,  <last argument expression>
```

Arguments to C functions are **passed by value**: each function parameter is assigned the _value_ of the corresponding argument passed to it in the function call by the caller. Pass by value semantics mean that any change to a parameter’s value in the function (that is, assigning a parameter a new value in the function) is _not visible_ to the caller.

Here are some example function calls to the `max` and `print_table` functions listed earlier:

```c
int val1, val2, result;

val1 = 6;
val2 = 10;

/* to call max, pass in two int values, and because max returns an
   int value, assign its return value to a local variable (result)
 */
result = max(val1, val2);     /* call max with argument values 6 and 10 */
printf("%d\n", result);       /* prints out 10 */

result = max(11, 3);          /* call max with argument values 11 and 3 */
printf("%d\n", result);       /* prints out 11 */

result = max(val1 * 2, val2); /* call max with argument values 12 and 10 */
printf("%d\n", result);       /* prints out 12 */

/* print_table does not return a value, but takes two arguments */
print_table(1, 20);           /* prints a table of values from 1 to 20 */
print_table(val1, val2);      /* prints a table of values from 6 to 10 */
```

Here is another example of a full program that shows a call to a slightly different implementation of the `max` function that has an additional statement to change the value of its parameter (`x = y`):

```c
/* max: computes the larger of two int values
 *   x: one value
 *   y: the other value
 *   returns: the larger of x and y
 */
int max(int x, int y) {
    int bigger;

    bigger = x;
    if (y > x) {
        bigger = y;
        // note: changing the parameter x's value here will not
        //       change the value of its corresponding argument
        x = y;
    }
    printf("  in max, before return x: %d y: %d\n", x, y);

    return bigger;
}

/* main: shows a call to max */
int main(void) {
    int a, b, res;

    printf("Enter two integer values: ");
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);

    res = max(a, b);
    printf("The larger value of %d and %d is %d\n", a, b, res);

    return 0;
}
```

The following output shows what two runs of this program might look like. Note the difference in the parameter ``x’s value (printed from inside the `max`` function) in the two runs. Specifically, notice that changing the value of parameter `x` in the second run does _not_ affect the variable that was passed in as an argument to `max` after the call returns:

$ ./a.out
Enter two integer values: 11  7
  in max, before return x: 11 y: 7
The larger value of 11 and 7 is 11

$ ./a.out
Enter two integer values: 13  100
  in max, before return x: 100 y: 100
The larger value of 13 and 100 is 100

Because arguments are _passed by value_ to functions, the preceding version of the `max` function that changes one of its parameter values behaves identically to the original version of `max` that does not.

### [](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/functions.html#_the_stack)16.4.1. The Stack

The **execution stack** keeps track of the state of active functions in a program. Each function call creates a new **stack frame** (sometimes called an **activation frame** or **activation record**) containing its parameter and local variable values. The frame on the top of the stack is the active frame; it represents the function activation that is currently executing, and only its local variables and parameters are in scope. When a function is called, a new stack frame is created for it (_pushed_ on the top of the stack), and space for its local variables and parameters is allocated in the new frame. When a function returns, its stack frame is removed from the stack (_popped_ from the top of the stack), leaving the caller’s stack frame on the top of the stack.

For the example preceding program, at the point in its execution right before `max` executes the `return` statement, the execution stack will look like [Figure 1](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/functions.html#FigCFunctionSimple). Recall that the argument values to `max` passed by `main` are _passed by value_, meaning that the parameters to `max`, `x` and `y`, are assigned the values of their corresponding arguments, `a` and `b` from the call in `main`. Despite the `max` function changing the value of `x`, the change doesn’t affect the value of `a` in `main`.

![A stack with two frames: main at the bottom, and max on top of it.  Main’s stack frame has three variables, a (11), b (7) and res (undefined at this point).  Max’s stack frame also has three variables, x (11), y (7), and bigger (11).](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/_images/Function_simple.png)

The following full program includes two functions and shows examples of calling them from the `main` function. In this program, we declare function prototypes for `max` and `print_table` above the `main` function so that `main` can access them despite being defined first. The `main` function contains the high-level steps of the full program, and defining it first echoes the top-down design of the program. This example includes comments describing the parts of the program that are important to functions and function calls. You can also download and run the [full program](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/_attachments/function.c).

 */
int max(int n1, int n2);

/* A prototype for another function.  void is the return type of a function
 * that does not return a value
 */
void print_table(int start, int stop);

/* All C programs must have a main function.  This function defines what the

    int x, y, larger;

    printf("This program will operate over two int values.\n");

    printf("Enter the first value: ");
