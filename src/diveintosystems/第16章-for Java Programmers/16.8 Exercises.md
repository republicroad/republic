### Exercises for A1.4 Functions

1. Implement and test a power function (for positive integer exponents only). A call to your function should compute baseexp and might look like:
    
    ```c
    result = power(base, exp);
    ```
    

### Exercises for A1.5: Arrays and Strings

1. Copy the following program that contains an example of two different functions with array parameters: [array parameters example](https://diveintosystems.org/book/Appendix1/_attachments/array2.c).
    
    1. Try compiling and running it to understand what it is doing.
        
    2. Then complete the implementation of the `minimum` function and test it out.
        
    
2. Write a new program, that implements your own version of a string copy function that takes a destination and a source string and copies the source string to the destination string. Test it out in `main` by making calls to your string copy function with different string inputs and printing out the string copy results after each call.
